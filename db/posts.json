How we feel about something can bring fear or joy, depending on what a depiction solicits from our subconscious; what memory it connects to.

Especially when the reader are not a professional of the area, the emotion rule all the process of reading, as well as in any kind of art. Of course emotion may rule the reading of scholars too, it is essential, but, when we need to analyze critically determined book, author, gender or translation, for example, may be necessary to keep emotion a little away, at least during the process of analysis. However, without emotion, Literature may be just a bunch of words incapable of making us vibrate, feel and, above all, enjoy. We can learn from it, of course, but the happiness of reading is what makes it an eternal subject of studies. Since Homer, and certainly before, Poetry was a way to keep people full of pleasure. In the end, emotions rule all our lives, including, of course, our interpretation about everything (sometimes we may call it a \"point of view\").

In a few short years we now have over 20 of the world's most powerful quantum computers, accessible for free on the IBM CloudAs a developer, you can join the world's largest quantum developer community.###########here's a simple explanation of quantum computing.For some problems, supercomputers aren’t that superUntil now, we’ve relied on supercomputers to solve most problems. These are very large classical computers, often with thousands of classical CPU and GPU cores. However, supercomputers aren’t very good at solving certain types of problems, which seem easy at first glance. This is why we need quantum computers.Imagine you want to seat 10 fussy people at a dinner party, where there is only one optimal seating plan out of all the different possible combinations. How many different combinations would you have to explore to find the optimal?Can you guess how many combinations?The answer is over 3 million and that's just 10 people around a table.Larger versions of these kinds of problems stump our most powerful supercomputers, because:Supercomputers don't have the working memory to hold the myriad combinations of real world problems.Supercomputers have to analyze each combination one after another, which can take a long time.################Since 2017 IBM Quantum has been working with clients and partners to solve problems like these. Here are real life quantum computing applications.Here are some examples:1- A new generation of electric vehicles through quantum battery technology.2-Reducing atmospheric carbon emissions using quantum computing aided material discovery.3-Searching for Higgs events and the origins of the universe.##################Why quantum computers are fasterFor over two decades, IBM has been pioneering the development of quantum computer systems to solve these sorts of problems in fundamentally news ways, making use of these two approaches.Quantum computers can create vast multidimensional spaces in which to represent these very large problems. Classical supercomputers cannot do this.Algorithms that employ quantum wave interference are then used to find solutions in this space, and translate them back into forms we can use and understand.Here’s why it mattersOne promising quantum algorithm that uses these techniques is called Grover's Search. Suppose you need to find one item from a list of N items. On a classical computer you'd have to check N/2 items on average, and in the worst case you would need to check all N.Using Grover's search on a quantum computer you would find the item after checking roughly √N of them. This represents a remarkable increase in processing efficiency and time saved. For example, if you wanted to find one item in a list of 1 trillion, and each item took 1 microsecond to check:Classical computer About 1 week.Quantum computer About 1 second.#############-- Superfluids:First we use superfluids to chill superconductors. We get these superconductors very cold – about a hundredth of a degree Celsius above absolute zero: the theoretically lowest temperature allowed by the laws of physics.-- Superconductors:When we put electrons through superconductors they pair up into something called Cooper pairs that quantum tunnel through something called a Josephson junction.Control:Essentially, this is a superconducting qubit. By firing photons at the qubit, we can control its behavior and get it to hold, change, and read out information.Superposition:A qubit itself isn’t very useful. However, by creating many and connecting them in a state called superposition we can create vast computational spaces. We then represent complex problems in this space using programmable gates.-- Entanglement:Quantum entanglement allows qubits, which behave randomly, to be perfectly correlated with each other. Using quantum algorithms that exploit quantum entanglement, specific complex problems can be solved more efficiently than on classical computers.-- Learn quantum computing programming:You can explore the world of quantum computing for free on the IBM Cloud, and learn to write quantum code – starting with absolute zero experience.IBM's quantum computers are programmed using Qiskit, a software development kit in Python.

I agree with you that a second GFC is on the horizon. The Global Financial System is highly complex, as you know, and depends on which jurisdiction we need to look at. The shadow banking systems differ enormously from nation to nation. The Chinese control their Commercial and Shadow Banking systems assiduously; they are managed with great precision with the two sectors in lockstep. They came to the rescue in 2008 with massive liquidity infusions into the global markets.I suppose we need to look at the USA as they effectively control the global financial system. Over the last 10 years, US companies have primarily funded themselves via corporate bond issuance owing to artificially low interest rates under QE.  This allows them to pay off any bank loan debt and switch to very low interest rates commercial bonds with long maturities. The majority of bonds, about 80 %, are rated 'Investment Grade' but we know, from 2008, that the ratings agencies are not necessarily correct.  Junk Bond issuance is 20 % or less. Many \"junk\" companies can actually be quite viable with good positive cashflows, so we need to look at that category and analyse it carefully. To set the scene, let's look at the numbers:Total Corporate Bond issuance is currently about $10 Trillion and Current Total Issuance is around $2 Trillion pa. Total US Bond Market is approximately $50 - $52 Trillion (including Corporate Bonds). Source: https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/fixed-income-chart/Now, compare the above Total Commercial Bank Loans at $10 Trillion and add Total Mortgages at $17.6 Trillion plus above Bond market and we get an estimated Total Debt at around $80 TrillionNow compare this to these liquid assets:Total Housing Market Valuation = $44 Trillion (semi liquid)Total Stock Market Valuation = $53 TrillionTotal Bond Market Valuation = $50 TrillionSource: https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/and https://www.zillow.com/research/us-housing-market-total-value-2021-30615/We can now deduce a Total Wealth estimate of $150 Trillion, deduct Total Debt and we have in USA a Net Wealth of around $ 70 Trillion.My colleague at: http://boomfinanceandeconomics.com/#/posted an article recently about Money Supply Expansion via Quantitative Easing Programs: Source: https://www.theburningplatform.com/2021/11/09/central-banks-step-back-luc-montagnier-warning-comparing-yield-curves-11-07-2021/#more-252637\"The central banks that have purchased the most assets over time are the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank. Together, they hold around US$ 24.6 Trillion worth of assets (expressed in US Dollar Terms) on their balance sheets. That sounds like a huge amount but it is important to understand that these assets have been accumulated over long periods of time.It is also important to understand that the assets purchased represent a fairly small portion of total assets available for purchase in their respective economies and they also represent a fairly small part of their cumulative economic activity (GDP) over the time taken in acquisition.Let’s look at the US, for example. The total assets value available for purchase in the US is estimated to be around US$ 125 Trillion. The Federal Reserve now owns approximately $ 8.5 Trillion of those. This is just 6.8 % of the total. However, if we look at the Fed’s asset holdings compared to cumulative GDP over the last 12 years, then it is half that — (about) 3.4 %.So, the US central bank has spent funds equivalent to just 3.4 % of cumulative GDP in order to support the US economy during a period of great economic uncertainty and great challenge — firstly, following the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 (when many US banks were on the brink of insolvency) and then following the Global Covid Fear and Panic Crisis of 2020. In BOOM’s opinion, the 3.4 % expended is a very modest sum. So, if the central banks slow or stop their purchases of assets, will it really have much impact? The answer is Yes and No.Yes, it will have impact in nations where the economy is fragile and unable to generate sufficient fresh new money supply via new bank loan creation. And No, it will not matter in nations where the economy is on a strong pathway to stable growth generated by steady bank loan demand and therefore a growing supply of fresh new money.When looked at this way, you can see that the central banks have acted fairly prudently over the last 12 years. Many commentators have continually talked about “massive money printing” and “risks of high CPI inflation, even Hyperinflation”. These comments are exaggerated to generate sensation as far as BOOM can see.Granted, the sums of money involved seem monstrous, even extreme, to most people who are not accustomed to thinking in Billions and Trillions. But when looked at over time and in relation to total cumulative GDP and the total asset situation, they are not so outrageous.While the QE arguments rage, BOOM concentrates on the shape of the sovereign bond yield curves for each nation. This is a significant indicator of financial stability for the present and for the future.\"","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"2"},{"answer_post_date":"2nd Feb, 2022","answer_content":"Thank you for all the replies, comments and information, especially to Peter Underwood.

Rainstorm: rainfall process with 30 ~ 70mm of precipitation within 12 hours or 50 ~ 100mm of precipitation within 24 hours. Heavy rain: the precipitation process of 70 ~ 140 mm in 12 hours or 100 ~ 250mm in 24 hours.

As per my understanding this would imply lower vacuum fluctuations in that \"hole\".My physical intuition tells me that such a device is impossible, because vacuum fluctuation are very fundamental linked with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and because of \"homogenity\" of spacetime (at least in the framework of flat space time, ignoring Unruh-effect etc.).

In a non-local universe there exists no randomness between the magnitudes of these local electromagnetic amplitudes. The increase or decrease of the energy of a local amplitude is equal to the addition or subtracting of 1 quantum (Planck’s constant) to/from the magnitude of the distinct amplitude. But we don’t know the “source” of the change of magnitude. That means that it can be the result of the influence of more than one of the amplitudes of the “points” around. (If you apply a metric and corresponding structure to the properties of space itself the description is more “tangible”.)Stable concentrations of energy – matter particles – can only be created by means of a reduction of the amplitudes of the geometrical “points” of the structure of the electromagnetic field around (set theory). Thus if we detect a rest-mass carrying particle, there must be a volume of decreased electromagnetic amplitudes around if there is not too much disturbance (the law of conservation of energy).

Randomness can only exist if there are no absolute conservation laws and no absolute physical constants. Thus in a non-local universe – everything influences everything at exactly the same moment – we never can determine all the involved influences.Vacuum energy is the “power” behind the dynamical part of the volume of our universe. In the early universe there was a period that there was no matter to be find. That means that the static part of the universe was restricted to the volume of the flat Higgs field and the dynamical part was the volume of the electromagnetic field. In other words, there were only vacuum fluctuations and these fluctuations exist because of the “internal power” of space itself. The mathematical consequence is that the power to change the universe on and on is identical everywhere within the volume of the universe. Thus observable reality is the result of a continuous transformation of the local properties in the universe (QFT).

There is a paper from Sabine Hossenfelder (2013). “Minimal length scale scenarios for quantum gravity.” https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.6169.pdf (see page 5, “A minimal history”)Page 5 describes the hypothesis of Werner Heisenberg and others that space itself has a structure and the structure has a size of ≈ 1 x 10-15 m. The described metric of the Planck length by Sabine Hossenfelder is “fantasy” because Max Planck had no idea of the origin of the force of gravitation. Nevertheless, he used the gravitational constant in his derivation of the Planck units. (see Louis Rancourt, Philip J. Tattersall (2015), \"Further Experiments Demonstrating the Effect of Light on Gravitation\". http://dx.doi.org/10.5539/apr.v7n4p4 The paper shows that gravity is a push force from vacuum space around (actually a vector force, super positioned on the vectors of the magnetic field in vacuum space).In other words, quantum fluctuations are manifestations of the “power to change” of every unit of the structure of space and all the units have identical basic properties.

Literature review cannot objectively answer a research question. On the other hand, systematic reviews, are research projects by themselves and can answer research questions. They are conducted based on stated methodology. There are several types of systematic reviews (systematic reviews of effectiveness studies, systematic reviews of prevalence studies, Systematic reviews of qualitative evidence, scoping reviews, systematic reviews of mixed methods studies, systematic reviews of diagnostic studies, etc). Just like primary studies, we can have systematic reviews of mixed methods studies (e.g, to synthesize evidence of effectiveness and evidence of meaningfulness and [resent in a single article).  Nevertheless, it does not mean that we combine literature reviews with primary studies and call them systematic reviews. Neither does it mean that we can combine systematic reviews and primary studies. I do not see the advantage of mixing them when we can present them separately. The scoping review may help you to identify gaps in evidence, information on how the subject has been investigated by others, and how the subject of interest has been conceptualized. Even if it helps you this way, it cannot constitute a component of a methodology in your report of primary study. You may use the evidence to present the rationale for the conduct of your study. You may mention why and how you conceptualized your primary study based on the evidence you found from the scoping review. That does not mean that you are using mixed methods.

In any development, there are a number of key factors that must be present, as you all probably know. We do both hardware and software development, and have informally \"tested\" different development approaches to both.What we have found is, regardless of anything we develop, specific tools / techniques / methods are critical, such as requirements management (the most critical tool), good operational analysis (which includes, amongst others, critical techniques such as functional analysis, functional architecture design, high-level requirements allocation etc), and others.Hardware can be Agiled (in our view) when the initial concept definition has addressed the risks associated with any iterative and incremental development methods, such as Agile, and when a modular approach is followed. There are brilliant management tools in the Agile philosophy (scrums etc), but hardware is time-consuming and very expensive to do in an incremental fashion if requirements change, unless the overall functionality and all associated non-functional requirements have been clearly defined and agreed upon with the client at the early stages of development (this holds true for ANY development, if you wish to save time and limit cost). It is easier to struggle than to think, but it is cheaper to think than to struggle.For example, it is not always possible to perform a complete build-and-test with hardware, but one can define and baseline interfaces and functionality, so the overall design can be evaluated during a sprint cycle by using definitions of not-yet-existing hardware instead of the real thing - modelling plays a big role here. In software, modules can be defined initially and then integrated as the design goes along - this works very well for software development.In the end, one has to consider both technical and project risks, and use techniques that minimize the risk. So, it also depends on the maturity of the requirements definition. A car, for example, has become almost modular in a sense, and the functional requirements are fairly well-known, so the risks are limited and Agile can work to deliver in a short time. If the requirements are unknown, Agile could potentially identify shortfalls due to its rigorous approach to testing, but could also fail if requirements were not pegged at the onset (as with any other development method).We can spend ours on this topic (because I am deeply passionate about development), but the truth is that there are numerous considerations that must be made before a development takes place, and in many instances a hybrid of methods reduces the risk - experience will show which methods to use in your own environment.Our biggest successes have always been when the initial work was done correctly, clearly, and timely.Hope this adds value!","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"15th Oct, 2013","answer_content":"In the line of the previous response, a key factor for success is to deeply analyze the characteristic of your development before deciding the development strategy to be used in your project.

Every chemical plant that exploded was the result of applying a predictive process control system to an empirical process. They pointed out that traditional project management is a predictive process control system which will lead to large failure rates whenever changes in requirements exceed a few percent. That is why the software project failure rate is 89% for traditional project management. It is a totally inappropriate process control mechanism in an environment where 65% of requirements change during development. In fact, the Professors laughed at us for being so stupid and continuing to do waterfall project management in the face of overwhelming project failure. They said read the process control book and make Scrum an empirical process control system.You can read how the FBI solved the 911 tracking problem in my book \"Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in half the Time.\" The first chapter describes the details of the project to integrate all data needed to track terrorists.

The FBI hired an agile CIO and CTO. They put about 10% of the original staff in the basement of the FBI building doing Scrum and completed the project for less than $50M.

The point is that, for example, additional money printed and given to citizens in subsidies or tax breaks should not only serve as generators of consumption growth and inflation. But also to be used to build new power plants based on renewable energy sources. Unfortunately, this kind of short-term, politically simplest strategy of economic growth activation is still used, for example, in the country where I operate. This is a politically convenient solution for the government, but unfortunately it is primarily a short-term strategy without looking at what will be in a decade, two decades, etc. It is a strategy of wearing pink glasses and telling citizens through government-controlled media that tomorrow is not important only now. It is a strategy not to look up, referring to the main motto of the dramatic image presented in the film \"Don't Look Up\" (starring Leonardo Di Caprio, Jennifer Lawrence and Meryl Streep), which in December 2021 appeared on internet portals filmmaking. In this cinematic depiction of the impending doom of planet Earth, both the world of politics and business either ignore the topic or try to earn extra money from it. The main message of the film can be interpreted as a paraphrase of other global problems of civilization development that are now widely ignored. For example, during the UN Climate Summit COP26, held in Glasgow, Scotland, there were further declarations of greenhouse gas emission reductions submitted by individual countries for the time horizon: 2030-2070. On the other hand, the sixth IPCC Report \"Climate Change 2021: the Physical Science Basis\", published on August 9, 2021, i.e. the sixth report summarizing the current and predicted climate changes prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change operating at the United Nations, clearly indicates that if all complex since the Paris Agreement of 2015 and individual COP Climate Summits to date, declarations are still not enough to stop the scale of the average atmosphere temperature increase at 1.5%. (counting from the temperature level before the first industrial revolution). And on this depends the most in terms of reducing the negative effects of a global climate catastrophe, which may already occur at the end of the 21st century. Answering the above question, in my opinion green economies should not exist outside green markets. In addition, green markets are part of sustainable, circular green economies. On the other hand, the development of green economies, in my opinion, should be carried out as quickly as possible by efficiently carrying out the pro-environmental transformation of the classic growth, brown, linear surplus economy into a sustainable, green, zero-emission zero-growth economy and a circular economy.

It is impossible to know what God expects of us.  But we can understand justice on our own.  Plato provided one definition of justice that essentially defines the basic requirement of morality.  In Republic, he said that people with power are responsible for the welfare of others.  He gave the examples of a ship's captain looking out for his men and a doctor looking out for his patient.  In an article I wrote, I referred to the definition of justice exemplified by these examples as the Dependency Principle.  I think of the Dependency Principle as a standard of judgment rather than conduct because before you can take care of someone who is helpless in a particular situation, you have to have the resources to help.  In contrast, Kant considered his Categorical Imperative (referred to above by Daniela Sorea) as a standard of conduct.  It is easy to know what is moral when we see someone overwhelmed by reality.  But what is the right thing to do when people have different values with respect to ambiguous matters such as abortion or assisted suicide as a means of coping with a terminal illness?  Well, for that we have what I call the Democracy Principle, which counsels that in matters of ambiguity, the individual may exercise independence of judgment.  For example, the First Amendment protection of freedom of religion is an application of the Democracy Principle.

R: You can create your own gods or God. Mankind is always creating gods. I proppose something experimental for you: Ask God to appear or manifest to you. Then, create a religion based in your own personal revelation. I believe that, if there are God, Gods, Goddess, Goddesses, the clues about theis existence are written in nature itself; so lets read it. Sacred Books and prophets are just fingers pointing for the ultimate reality or ultimate non-sense. Do not trust them, but experience for yourself. Also, some religions do not have god or goddess. Buddhism is an atheistic religion. Does belief in the existence of God inevitably involve the adoption of an ethical system characteristic of a religion? No, just my opinion. I am not trying to be persuasive here.Religion is not about ethics. Religion is about the transcendental, is beyond mind and the dual world (my opinion).  If not, what ethics should you apply to know what God considers good and what bad? R: God could be amoral, imoral or moral; it is a possibility don't you think? Who knows after all? Morality is probably exclusive of  humans. Maybe other primates have morality also, but i am not sure.I think we all should learn philosophy and inquire what ethics we need apply to live in harmony with each other.  Just to begin the thinking: tolerance, non-violence ... Can one who believes in his/her God create his/her ethical system? Yes! do you want to live in a world which everybody is a killer? probably not, so... dont kill. Do you want to live in a world which everybody is a thief? probably not, so... dont be a thief.  Do you want to live in a world which everybody is a rapist? probably not, so... dont be a rapist. This is very simple, we can go deeper in each statement, but it is not my aim here. I am not a prophet.What would be the sources of such ethics? Science and philosophy. It is necesssary to think. Acceptance of rules are not the Way(Tao).

In other words, when you experience God (i.e. realise you are a Son of God) then perforce you treat your fellow human beings as brothers and sisters, because, seeing that you are in fact a Son of God yourself, you cannot fail to see a [potential] Son of God in every fellow human being. This is what Jesus of Nazareth actually taught 2000 years ago, but the well-meaning apostles turned this simple teaching into a manmade religion of the \"risen Christ\" which subsequently became Christianity. But in this time of transition between one age and the next, I have come into the world to restore the light of truth and be a living example of how my predecessor (i.e. Jesus) would have lived, if he was here today.And as for the second part of your question, concerning ethics: the inevitable consequence of the realisation of the brotherhood described above is the Golden Rule: do to others what you would want them to do to you. But as you become God-conscious and identify with God you begin to love your brothers and sisters with another, more sublime, kind of love --- a fatherly love. And thus the Golden Rule turns into an \"Enhanced Golden Rule\", namely: do to others what you know God would do to them. In practice, this distinction is not very important, but in the inner experience it gives you an extra level of joy and satisfaction of not only revealing in your life the Son of God, but also God the Father and, finally, your actual deeds are so permeated with the presence of the Spirit of God, that the Three become One.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"2"},{"answer_post_date":"9th Nov, 2019","answer_content":"Dear Krzysztof Trzcinski Every human being has an ancestor, of course his descendants will follow each of the customs and cultures of his ancestors.

Something or someone that causes a person to sin is a bad example for babes in Christ to follow. Simply putting it, they lead others astray. Another horrific example is when Saints partake in gossip or witness to someone else sowing discord. If new converts are present and no correction is make, it becomes a stumbling block making them believe that such behavior is acceptable.Those who delight in the Christian Bible are delighted to be the Living God people and desire to spend time in His presence.

Once this type of a conflict is over, the second conflict is a multinational competition in playing a dominating role in a society -that can keep a country down for many decades. Then, once a country got rid from religious and national conflicts and significantly improved their economic prestige and status, a new conflict abscess is bruing and bursting - people at the bottom of the well being ladder begin fighting for power to redisribute the wealth  with the people in the middle, and at the top of that ladder. Conflicts are never ending! The root cause in each particular case is a conflict of interests. However, interests them-selves are ever changing!In summary: scientists / researchers ought to be impartial to inform a society on what are vulnerabilities and threats to a society's well being, and what's the least painful way to move ahead for the time being according to the threat analyses.

It often behoves is to ask why someone is claiming objectivity, if and when they do. That doesn't mean that we ought not seek the truth; to the contrary, I simply have in mind that seeking the truth (whatever it may be) is something that is *done* (or attempted), not merely *asserted*. And our efforts to achieve it are highly fallible. While we often talk about *persons* being objective or non-objective, I think it's more fruitful to ask about our degrees of confidence concerning the truth of propositions, claims, explanations, theories, etc. It seems to me we are more likely to arrive at justified beliefs concerning matters of fact through the contestation of rival hypotheses and arguments, experimentation, surveying a plurality of perspectives, and so on. The different perspectives, experiences, and competencies that people develop as a result of participating either inside or outside a specific institution, way of life, religion, etc. are often valuable in their own ways, in relation to specific issues. For example, when it comes to Christianity, I find that the perspectives of external critics (e.g., Feuerbach, Marx, Nietzsche, et al.) extraordinarily valuable, but so too are those of internal critics (e.g., Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, Daly, et al.), as well as those who seek to work inside in a constructive manner (e.g., Tillich, Rahner, Moltmann, et al.). I'm not sure what it would be to have an objective view on religion per se, but when it comes to specific claims about religious practices, doctrines, social functions or consequences, etc., all of these perspectives can bear on and inform a considered judgment about the truth-value of the claim in question, especially for someone who is genuinely concerned with arriving at justified, true beliefs. Often, what worries us—and what I think animates this question—is a recognition that we don't know whether people are honestly and carefully observing, reporting, and analyzing the matters in question, or simply engaging in reactionary defense, posturing, and rationalization. I suspect that sometimes individuals don't even know themselves! That's why communal discernment, criticism, and review are so important.

In general, many colleagues which use Geodesign in their planning education, research and practice recognise the importance and use social media data analysis.

Immanuel Kant's three main philosophical writings were each associated with the concept of critique: Critique of Pure Reason, Critique of Practical Reason, Critique of Judgement. \"Critique\" here means examining the possibilities of knowledge and its limits. \"Reason\" as the supreme organ of our ability to question our knowledge and our ideologies. Scientific thinking has always been critical thinking (againskt dogmatic thinking) , also in the application of methods that must be appropriate to the subject matter to be dealt with. Critical thinking has appeared in the 20th century partly with an inflated claim to itself: Those authors who claimed to be particularly critical (and all others uncritical) were able to criticise other authors, but rather one-sidedly by applying a certain worldview that they considered \"true\", e.g. Marxism, and in this way considered all other views uncritical. One should therefore be familiar with the recent history of science, from about the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, in order to be able to answer the question somewhat critically - and not one-sidedly - as to what one should understand by the term \"critical\" today.

Including the “answers” in the posts above have to the objective reality too indirect relations – human’s consciousness isn’t some mystic “Orchestrated objective reduction”, “…a kind of behavior that, of course, is controlled by the brain like any other behavior...”, etc.The fundamental phenomena/ notions in human’s sciences above can be, and are, scientifically defined only in the Shevchenko-Tokarevsky’s “The Information as Absolute” conception https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260930711_the_Information_as_Absolute  DOI 10.5281/zenodo.268904, - where it is rigorously proven that there exist nothing else than some informational patterns/systems of the patterns that are elements of the absolutely fundamental and absolutely infinite “Information” Set;- and so  “Matter” and \"Consciousnesses”  are nothing else than some informational systems, which are constructed basing on some sets of fundamental [eventually logical] laws/links/constants. I.e. Matter and the consciousness [though human’s consciousness is only utmost developed version of the informational system “consciousness on Earth”] are some rough analogues of the informational system “a computer+ a program shell”. However  Matter and consciousness are based on fundamentally different sets of basic laws/links/constants; and so  the primary “microchips” in “hardwares” and the “shells” in these systems  are fundamentally different as well, and so, say, any consciousness principally cannot “emerge” from any material structure. Nonetheless the fundamentally non-material consciousness is able to impact on material structures, and so has built for herself material residence, which is stable in the Set a few billions of years ago on Earth, and uses these residences as the sable houses till now.Including the brain(s) is only some practically material the consciousness’s hardware module, which, functionally, first of all:- transforms material signals of practically material body’s sensors with information about environment into codes that are understandable by non-material hardware’s modules;- stores on a long time processed by consciousness information, and- transforms practically material energy, which the body obtains at consuming food, into form, which is consumable by the non-material modules, what  is in this case the  next step in existent in Life on Earth food chain, where bacteria and plants consume purely material energy of radiation and chemical reactions, transforming this energy into consumable for more complex living beings’ bodies form, which eat bacteria and plants,  and each other.More see the first approximation model of consciousness on Earth, which is based on the conception above- at least two SS comments Dec 9, 2019 and Dec 10, 2019 inhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/329539892_The_Information_as_Absolute_conception_the_consciousness/comments?focusedCommentId=5ded35bacfe4a777d4f8a648&sldffc=0  , and, of course, the whole paper.More see also the first link in the post, to understand the conception in this case is useful to read a few SS posts [starting from  March 26 post, begins as \" Dear Dragoljub, \"]  in the short thread https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_is_the_difference_between_matter_energy_and_information Cheers","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"2"},{"answer_post_date":"2nd Apr, 2020","answer_content":"Yes","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"12th Apr, 2020","answer_content":"I have just published a Preprint of the article: \"Full automated system-cognitive analysis of the periodic criteria classification of forms of consciousness by Prof. E.V.

In 1979-1981, two monographs were written on higher forms of consciousness, perspectives of man, technology and society. One of these monographs was a two-volume book called: \"Theoretical bases of synthesis of quasi-biological robots\". These monographs have suggested: 1) criteria-based periodic classification of 49 forms of consciousness, including higher forms of consciousness (VFS); 2) psychological, microsocial and technological methods of transition between different forms of consciousness based on this classification, including methods of transition from the usual form of consciousness to VFS; 3) information and functional theory of technology development (including the law of improving the quality of the basis); 4) information theory of value; 5) 11 functional schemes of technical systems of future forms of society, including systems of remote mirotelekinetic (mental) control; 6) the concept of society development in groups of socio-economic formations; 7) the concept of determining the form of human consciousness by the functional level of the technological environment; 8) mathematical and numerical modeling of the dynamics of the probability density of human States of consciousness in evolution using the theory of Markov random processes. This paper provides a complete automated system-cognitive analysis (ASC-analysis) of the periodic criteria classification of forms of consciousness, proposed by the author in 1978. To do this, the paper solves the following tasks: cognitive structuring and formalization of the subject area; synthesis and verification of statistical and system-cognitive models (multiparametric typing of forms of consciousness); system identification of forms of consciousness; their typological analysis; research of the modeled subject area by studying its model.

Basically, you are asking if self survives death, which is still controversial. However, it can be addressed in a  proposed real-time-OBE-experiment as follows:   A proposed experiment for investigating the underlying mechanism for “real” (100% disconnection) OBE on real-time basis and for testing the null hypothesis: the self-as-subject does not survive death The out-of-body-experience (OBE) is well accepted in neuroscience as an evolved phenomenon that has survival value under some conditions involving risk to life. In current neuroscience, it is a mindbrain-based phenomenon and is considered one of the various types of hallucinations. Null hypothesis: A scientific hypothesis should be testable/ falsifiable. Therefore, a testable/falsifiable null hypothesis related to OBE is proposed: The self-as-subject operates through OBEr’s gross-physical brain-body (GPB) in real-time during OBE. How do we rule out the possibility that the “self” is operating through GPB on a real-time basis during OBE? If we can rule it out then it will give us clues for testing another very important null hypothesis based on materialistic neuroscience: the self-as-subject does not survive death.Proposed design of a cost-free experiment: The experimenter can keep objects (such as random numbers written on a paper or objects or equivalent) behind the OBEr so that the eyes of her/his GBP cannot see, and then ask the OBEr to report the real-time activities behind the GPB. If the OBEr can report/see the object (from-up-the-ceiling perspective) correctly then we rule out that possibility and the null hypothesis can be rejected. Otherwise, we cannot reject the null hypothesis.In other words, the OBErs with true OBE (OBE with 100% disconnection from her/his GPB) should able to report correctly the objects and/or random numbers (RNs) written on a paper and kept behind the GPB in real-time-online basis. Usually, all OBErs feel that they are 100% disconnected, but are they really? The proposed experiment will scientifically test it. Since OBE is spontaneous and last for few minutes (such as less than 2 min), it is always good idea to keep RN-paper behind her/his GPB (ask a friend to tape the paper on the back so that that paper is invisible to GPB’s eyes).To sum up, a “true” OBEr (100% disconnection from the OBEr’s GPB) should satisfy all the following criteria (Criteria 5-11 are advised by Dominique Surel): (1) The OBEr should able to read the random numbers behind the GPB in real-time-online basis. (2) The OBEr should honestly self-report that they have an OBE. (3) Perform control experiment during no-OBE state (by asking the OBEr to read different RNs which are kept behind her/his GPB). If the OBEr doesn’t report correctly then for the purpose of experiment on that day the OBEr have no other psychic abilities such as clairvoyance, RV, CRV, telepathy, etc. This does not mean that the OBEr will not have this ability in future through proper training. (4) These experiments must be done in the presence of skeptic scientists from start to finish making sure they are not done in a sloppy way. Hopefully, these criteria scientifically demonstrate that it was a true OBE experiment because the person correctly read the numbers.(5) Hear and report a conversation. (6) Read anything such as headlines of a newspaper, title of book?(7) Read: numbers, letters(8) See objects a/ behind people,  b/ behind furniture, c/ behind a wall, and also behind the GPB of the OBEr.(9) Move: a/ anywhere in the room  b/ outside the room by going through a wall c/vertically (up/down). (10) Speak and be heard?(11) Important criteria: The ideal environment for this type of experiment would be to blindfold the OBEer and take him into a room that he is not familiar. Once he has the OBE, whatever he describes will not be from memory since he has never been in the room before. Also, keeping the blindfold will demonstrate whether or not he is looking through his GPB's eyeballs.On <The participant might say he's having one, although he might not be, but if he is a powerful remote viewer or other psychic skill (without realizing it) through natural skills, he might be able to check all of your criteria, but it will not prove he had an OBE and it would be a mistake to conclude he did it through OBE when we can't even prove he had an OBE in the first place. (Surel)> I agree. However, we will be testing her/him thru other criteria so if s/he is not OBEr then we will soon find it. The reason for keeping it as one of the criteria is, in the first person subjective (1pp) research, subject’s 1pp report is also counted.On <How will the participant manifest his/her OBE? (Surel)>. If the activities of TPJ (temporal parietal junction) and AG (angular gyrus) are disturbed by some means, system ejects the subtle ethereal body (SEB) from person’s GPB (gross physical body). This happens spontaneously, samādhi state, drugs (ketamine: (Dietrich, 2020) and (Bower, 2011)), accidents, cardiac arrest, near death terminal cases, and perhaps applying rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) (Jay et al., 2014). NDE is also a type of OBE.As per (Jay et al., 2014), “Patients with medication-resistant DSM-IV DPD (N = 17) and controls (N = 20) were randomized to receive one session of right-sided rTMS to VLPFC or temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). […] The TPJ region was chosen due to its relevance in out of body experiences (OBEs), researched previously using TMS [40,41]”[Articles: 40. Blanke O., Ortigue S., Landis T., Seeck M.

[PMC free article] [PubMed] [Google Scholar](Levitan, LaBerge, et al., 1999), (Blanke et al., 2002), and (Blanke et al., 2005)]Justifications: Neuroscientists could argue that OBErs were getting information (related to up from neck, i.e., their face head, ears, nose, cheeks, and eyes located on their GPB) from their cortical homunculus <Cortical homunculus>, which were stored in their long-term memory (LTM) when they saw themselves in front of a mirror or from their photos. However, whatever was going during OBErs’ OBE behind their gross physical brain-body (GPB) in real-time-online cannot be stored in their long-term memory. Therefore, if OBErs can report online-real-time activities (such as seeing objects and reading random numbers written on a paper, etcetera) behind their GPBs from the out-of-brain-body (GPB) perspective during their OBEs then OBE may not be mindbrain-based. This is a testable and falsifiable cost-free experiment to test the null hypothesis that the OBE is mindbrain-based. In other words, a scientifically easily testable and falsifiable hypothesis is: the subjective experiences (SEs) from the location out of OBEr’s gross physical body (GPB) fail to provide online-real-time activities hidden from OBEr’s gross physical body (GPB). If it is rejected then one could argue that the self-as-subject is 100% disconnected from OBEr’s GPB. In that case, how could we explain the vivid memory of OBE/NDE of the OBEr? There is a significant difference between (a) “true” (100% disconnect) OBE and (b) similar appearing psi such as clairvoyance, RV, CRV, and telepathy. In the former (a) the self-as-subject appears to be located outside of GPB (gross physical brain-body) and in the latter (b) the self-as-subject is located in the GPB.Justification for using reading random numbers: It is assumed that a “true” (100% disconnection) OBEr does not operate thru her/his GPB. So s/he is like us in normal mundane reading the RNs written in o a paper kept in front of us with 20-20 vision; i.e., it is DIRECT reading with 100% accuracy. We will enlarge the random numbers to match for the 20-20 (or better) vision. We need to exclude who have other psychic abilities on that day when we perform the experiments. In other words, we need exclude the data of such psychic subjects from the data analysis related to “true” OBErs. The RNs are very useful and important for excluding CRVers, RVers, clairvoyants, and telepathists. Yes, we can use symbols, letter, objects, etc. for other psychic abilities such as CRV, RV, Clairvoyance, and telepathy. But for a \"true\" OBE, reading the random numbers might be the best because it is direct reading like we do on laptop or paper in our mundane life.Control experiments: It is assumed that clairvoyance, remote viewing, CRV, and telepathy are not involved. It is directly reading the numbers. It is a local viewing. We could design control experiments for clairvoyance, RV, CRV, and/or telepathy without OBE: if at normal-wakeful state without OBE, the subjects are able to read the random numbers written on paper and placed behind their GPB, then their data will be excluded from the data analysis of OBEs. As per (Annus, 2020), “An out-of-body experience [OBE] is defined by the presence of three phenomenological characteristics: disembodiment (location of the self outside one’s body), the impression of seeing the world from a distant and elevated visuo-spatial perspective, and the impression of seeing one’s own body from this elevated perspective [(Brugger et al, 1997)]”. As per Wikipedia, “Clairvoyance … is the claimed ability to gain information about an object, person, location, or physical event through extrasensory perception.[2][3]”In OBE, the self-as-subject is apparently located outside of GPB (gross physical brain-body), whereas in clairvoyance the self-as-subject is located within GPB. The subjects do not report OBE in clairvoyance-state. As elaborated, a control experiment can be performed in non-OBE state to test if the subject has clairvoyance. A true OBE is defined as OBE with 100% disconnection from her/his GPB, and OBErs with true OBE should able to report the objects and/or random numbers (RNs) written on a paper and kept behind the GPB in real-time-online basis. The issue of ‘subtle light brain-body’ / ‘subtle brain-body’ (SLB/SBB) / ‘astral body’ will be addressed later if OBErs are successful in reading the numbers through other control experiments. This issue was raised by Vinod Sehgal on19Nov2020 (personal communication): “Where is the scientific evidence  for the existence of any SLB/ SBB, which has  a self and which shall read random number,  thru direct mapping or otherwise? Without this evidence, the existence of a self as surviving death can't be deduced scientifically even if hidden random number is read correctly.” As per neuroscience, OBErs will not able to read them and SLB/SBB does not exist, so we will address this issue after the experiment and its conclusion. If OBErs report correctly the object(s)/RNs(random numbers), then it is a great achievement because this paranormal phenomenon will enter into mainstream science for further research. This will be a great news because it will change physics and neuroscience. This is the main goal of the experiment. To rule out if it is due to clairvoyance/remote-viewing/telepathy (CRVT), as elaborated above, we will perform control experiments at non-OBE states with the object(s)/RNs placed in another room or remote distances, if they respond correctly then results might be due to their CRVT ability.If the OBErs cannot read such RNs (hidden from their GPB’s eyes), then the OBErs are not 100% disconnected from their respective GPBs, which implies that they are not “true” OBErs. This means that either “true” OBErs do not exist or we keep on searching for them. In the latter case, the neuroscience’s claim (self-as-subject does not survive death) will hold until we find such “true” OBErs. On the other hand, if true OBErs exist then the self-as-subject survives death.If a goal is how to bring any of the paranormal phenomena into mainstream science (MSS), the existence of “real” OBE (100% disconnection from the OBEr’s GPB) is in one of them.It is unclear if the OBErs were 100% disconnected from their gross-physical-brain-body (GPB). To test them, our proposed experiment will be useful. Perhaps, there is no disconnection in OBE; it is all endogenously generated subjective experiences, which are true in the world of imagination similar to dreams as elaborated in (Levitan, LaBerge, et al., 1999) on <“Out -of-body experiences,” dreams, and REM sleep>.

The proposed experiment is designed to give us some clue for further research to answer this query.Cheers!Best regards,Ram......The 54facets/sub-aspects/notions of the self/selfhoodFrom various disciplines/investigations, so far, there are 54 facets/sub-aspects/notions of the self/selfhood, which are listed below.(Strawson, 1999) lists the following facets of self but are not his view of self: “[1] the conceptual self, [2] the contextualized self, [3] the core self [(Damasio, 2010)], [4] the dialogic self, [5] the ecological self, [6] the embodied self, [7] the emergent self, [8] the empirical self, [9] the existential self, [10] the extended self [(Kim and Johnson, 2014)], [11] the fictional self [no-self (Metzinger, 2003) because the self is a construct of the brain that can be easily modified], [12] the full-grown self, [13] the interpersonal self, [14] the material self [objects and cultural artifacts: (Woźniak, 2018)], [15] the [Me in] narrative self, [16] the philosophical self, [17] the physical self, [18] the private self [and [19] public self], [20] the representational self, [21] the rock bottom essential self, [22] the semiotic self, [23] the social self [human beings: (Woźniak, 2018), (Moutoussis et al., 2014; Friston and Frith, 2015)], [24] the transparent self, and [25] the verbal self (cf. e.g., James, 1890; Stern, 1985; Dennett, 1991; Gibson, 1993; Neisser, 1994; Cole, 1997; Butterworth, 1998; Gazzaniga, 1998; Legerstee, 1998; Gallagher and Marcel, 1999; Pickering, 1999; Sheets-Johnstone, 1999), none of whom I object to, although I have not chosen to write about them”.In addition, [26] proto self and [27] [Me in] autobiographical self: (Damasio, 2010) or continuous self (Newen, 2018)], [28] “the self that enjoys self-consciousness, which includes the sense of body ownership (‘this is my arm’), the sense of agency (‘this is my action’), the sense of authorship of thoughts (‘this is my thought’)” (Newen, 2018), sense of self in agency and perception (Hohwy, 2007) [29] “working self [=contextually relevant part of the self-model] must still involve explicit as well as implicit information if we want to describe the embodied self adequately concerning all its behavior, its behavioral dispositions, and its explicit autobiography (as expressed in narratives in a situation)” (Newen, 2018).As per (Newen, 2018), “We have to distinguish the self as subject from the self as object (e.g., Brockner and Wiesenfeld, 2016). The self as subject involves the self as (1a) bearer of one’s sensations and perceptions, (1b) as the agent of one’s action, (1c) as the owner of one’s body parts, (1d) as the center of one’s visual perspective and (1e) as the center of one’s cognitive perspective (including experiencing oneself as the author of one’s thoughts) (Synofzik et al., 2008b). Furthermore, the self as subject is characterized by its immunity to error through misidentification (Prosser and Recanati, 2012), i.e., it involves immediately self-related information such that the system the information is about cannot be misidentified because there is no identification involved, but just a specific kind of information processing that makes it about the system, where proprioception is such a type of information: the self as subject always contains information about itself even if in rare cases the proprioceptive information is evaluated incorrectly, e.g., one may think one’s legs are crossed when they actually are not. The self as object involves recognition and conceptualization of the self, which is e.g., manifest in mirror self-recognition, which infants usually learn by 18 months. Another manifestation is any form of explicit conceptualization and description of oneself. The self as object always involves an identification process. Explicit contents of oneself constitute the so-called narrative self.”[30] “the phenomenal self (reflecting self-related content of consciousness)” (Woźniak, 2018) [the self-as-object (me-ness) or objective self?: “My arm is broken”, “I have a bump on my forehead”: (Wittgenstein, 1958)], [31] “by limiting ourselves to discussing conscious content representing one’s body one can speak about the bodily self” (Woźniak, 2018), self as a sense of bodily ownership (Apps and Tsakiris, 2014) [32] “by imposing limits to conscious experience of one’s possessions one can speak about one’s extended self” (Woźniak, 2018), [33] perceived self, and [34] free-energy self.As per (Gallagher, 2013) on <A pattern theory of self>, “we may want to add [35] “the neural self,” [36] “the synaptic self” (LeDoux, 2002); or what we might call [37]  “the midline self” [in reference to self-referential processes in the cortical midline structures (CMS) (Northoff and Bermpohl, 2004); “the midline theory of self (or for short, the midline self)” (Gallagher, 2013)]. […] Many of these concepts of self were developed in the plural. James (1890), for example, distinguished between the physical self, the social self, and the private self. Neisser (1988) discussed five types of self-knowledge corresponding to [6] the ecological self, [38] the interpersonal self, [2] the conceptual self, the extended self, and the private self. Despite the terminology suggesting a plurality of selves, however, Neisser (1991) carefully refers to them as aspects of self – e.g., the ecological aspect of self.” [39] Experiential aspects of self (Gallagher, 2013), [40] affective aspects of self (Gallagher, 2013), [41] situated aspects of self (Gallagher, 2013). [42] spiritual self (Poll and Smith, 2003), “self-as-object” as mental processes and content (Woźniak, 2018)). [43] The ‘facet of the “self” related to genetic and recorded/published information during life’s salient work/karma/action,’ which includes genetic and epigenetic information passed on to future generations, information during teaching passed on to students, published papers/books/personal-views, online postings, contributions to the world, recorded good/bad actions (karmas), etc. This facet of self surely survives death because it has obvious scientific evidence (Online discussion in the scientific basis of consciousness, 2020).[44] As per (Gallagher, 2000), Strawson view seems to be close to immediate/momentary self “a kind of bare locus of consciousness, void of personality” (Strawson, 1999), [45] cognitive self, [46] the self that is comprised OF time rather than contained IN time (Nunn, 2020), the self as A-series tensed-time (past, present, future) (McTaggart, 1908), or the self as an existence made/composed OF time (Pereira Jr., 2020). [47]. The ‘causal self’ as ‘causal holon identity’ arise in the mindbrain system through a cycle of 4 causes (material and efficient causes for unfolding the observable domain, and formal and final causes describing contextual domain) leading to “the emergence of anticipatory and evolutionary identity (including concepts of “self”)” in us (living systems) as a transcendental self “of fifth essence” (Kineman, 2018). Is ‘causal self’ \"I\" (self-as-subject) OR \"Me\" (self-as-object)? As per Kineman (personal communication on 5Nov2020), “It is both, also ‘it’ or ’they’ or ‘him/her'. Depends on what you relate it to. Remember, it is the causal structure of identity - that doesn’t specify which direction one is experiencing it from. That would be a relation with another system or a relation with internal systems. The identity that perceives the identity.” Does it survive death?[48] Volitional Self [:] As per (Inner Frontier, 2017), “When it comes to volition, to intention, agency, and will, the picture of who we are turns foggy indeed, being a mix of truth and illusion. The fact that we do things, that we cause things to happen, implies that there is someone, a self that is me, who is the causer, the doer, the decider and chooser. This is our apparent volitional self.The illusion serves to hide the fact that many, if not most, of our actions, are not decided upon or chosen by anyone. Instead, these actions are automatic, programmed by our conditioning, our history, our views, our opinions, and habits of action and reaction. Though we do not feel that we are choosing or deciding in such cases and though is there is no self, no chooser behind these automatic actions, we nevertheless assume that there is. We assume that everything we do is done and chosen by us. Thus, we allow the default creation of our volitional pseudo-self, who purportedly chooses everything we do. This automaton proves valuable and necessary. It takes care of so much of our life. It relieves us of needing to consider how to walk, how to wash dishes, how to type on a keyboard, and so much else. Yet though it pretends to be us, though we believe it to be us, we are not that mechanism. We are not our automatism.An entirely different situation occurs, however, when we are alert and present. When we are in this sense conscious, fully engaged, and not on autopilot, we do feel that we are choosing and deciding. In these conscious choices, we have a self, our true self, our I. This self, this I is driven by conscience, not by conditioning, programming, habit, and reaction, not by urges and impulses. This I works from foresight, wisdom, and compassion, from seeing the right thing to do and doing that. Most importantly, the further we delve into this I, the more we operate from that, the more we realize that this I, that we are not separate, that our innermost root is common to us all.Our automatic selfacts like a fog, obscuring our view and connection with our true self, our I. Our best tool for seeing through that fog is voluntary attention. This comes from us, from our I. When we intentionally place our attention somewhere, it is our I doing that. Attention is will, deriving from and directly connected with our personal will, our I. Attention can teach us the difference between the pseudo-self of conditioned, habitual, reactive, programmed actions and the true self, rooted in the timeless present, acting with real intention.Still, between the thoughts that think us, the emotions that drive us, the physical urges that capture us, and the inner passivity that eats our life, we are largely ruled by our conditioning. Yet we believe that all our choices and decisions are our own, are made by us, by our I. This is our fundamental illusion. For the great majority of our life, we are absent; we live as an automaton. But, we are much more than that.For this week, see the difference between the two types of volitional self. The false one that is little more than an assumption based on the conditioned actions of an automaton, and the true one that feels like you, that is you. Be at peace, open to your inner wisdom. Let your attention flow from you. Be your attention, and thereby be yourself.”[49] Perspectival self: As per (Sebastian, 2020), “Perspectival First-Person Awareness (PFP-Awareness): a non-conceptual identification-free self-attribution that defines the first-person perspective for our conscious experience.” According to (Martin, 2005), “The psychological self has been dismissed by some scientific naturalists and social constructionists as either illusory or fictitious. Arguments against strong forms of naturalism and constructionism that would deny the reality of the self are presented. More positively, the self is conceptualized as an embodied first-person perspective (an ‘I’) and understanding (a ‘me’), and a theory of its development during ontogenesis is presented. Following further discussion about the ‘reality status’ of the self thus understood, it is concluded that such a self is a legitimate target for expanded forms of psychological inquiry. […] Self studies are important to psychology understood as the study of human action and experience in the world. For, unlike other animals, humans are uniquely capable of a kind of personhood that, while evolved in a broad Darwinian sense, has proven adept at tethering itself historically to increasingly complex cultures (Donald, 2001). A necessary aspect of such an evolved, culturally sustained personhood has seemed to many to be the psychological self, understood both as a self-conscious first-person perspective (a psychological ‘I’) and as a conceptual self-understanding (a psychological ‘me’), through which we humans perceive, understand and act in the world. Since first theorized by William James (1890), some version of this dual-aspect psychological self has been a mainstay of much self theory and research in the discipline of psychology (e.g. Harr´e, 1998; McAdams, 1997; Mead, 1934). If both first-person experiences and self-understandings are not to count as real in a way that matters to human life on this planet, psychology dissolves into either physics or sociology, or assumes the status of folk beliefs and practices of interest to historians and cultural anthropologists.” As per (Noë, 2002), “As perceivers we are able to keep track of the ways in which our perceptual experience depends on what we do (e.g., on our movements). This capacity, which Hurley calls perspectival self-consciousness, is a special instance of our more general ability as perceivers to keep track of how things are. I argue that one upshot of this is that perspectival self-consciousness, like the ability to perceive more generally, relies on our possession of conceptual skills.”[50] Transcendental self (Chris Nunn), [51] Metaphysical self ((Searle, 2005), (Woźniak, 2018)), [52] “Pure Consciousness” or “Pure Self-Observing System” as in Advaita Vedanta (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Alex Hankey, and (Boyer, 2018), Jivatman/Atman (= Brahman) of Vedanta, Shaivism, and so on,   [53] the self-aware, independent, eternal/immortal, passive invariant self (PIS) (individualized Purusha, Drishta/witness) is from the non-interactive dualism-based Sankhya,[54] IDAM’s Individual dual-aspect-self for each of the above facets of self.We can categorize all notions of the self into two groups:(I) James’ “Me” (self-as-object in the sense of Phenomenology (experience of self, phenomenal self): Wittgenstein’s “I” (‘I see me in the mirror’) and/or Wittgenstein’s “Me” (‘I see me in the mirror’); this includes the notions/meanings/definitions/sub-aspects/facets of self as in [1]-[43]. In other words, “Me” (self-as-object) is the SE of self, i.e., self-experience/consciousness/awareness, which can include Damasio’s core self (np aspect) and the self (np aspect) that has neural-physical basis (NBP) = Northoff et al’s CSMS-NN and its activities = the p-aspect of a self-related state of a mindbrain system in the IDAM framework.(II) James’ “I” (self-as-subject (SAS), metaphysical self: “The self as a metaphysical fact that consciousness is subjective: ‘the Thinker that does the thinking’) in the sense of metaphysics (existence of self); this includes the notions/meanings/definitions/sub-aspects/facets of the self: [44]-[54]. In other words, “I” (self-as-subject) is experiencer/cognizer/thinker/actor; it is NOT the SE of self.We can further group SAS into two types/facets: (IIa) SAS in [44]-[49] that have a respective neural-physical basis (NPB) and (IIb) SAS in [50]-[53] that have respective subtle brain-body basis (SBB).In other words, if yogis are correct that SAS survives physical death then there are two facets of SAS: (IIa) SAS-in-GPB (such as cognitive self) with its own inseparable NPB and (IIb) SAS-in-SBB (such as metaphysical self) with its own inseparable SBB.[54] In the IDAM, we accept both facets of SAS without any internal inconsistency. In the IDAM (inseparable dual-aspect monism), the “self” is the experiencer/cognizer/actor (performer of actions) as a non-physical (np) aspect of a SAS-related state of a subject’s mindbrain system with respective either NPB or SBB as the inseparable physical (p) aspect.Just imagine you are in front of a mirror. (IIa) If SAS with its inseparable SBB resides in GPB then an OOBEr will experience two bodies: (a) whole SBB and (b) GPB below the neck, here SBB is superposed with GPB. If SAS-in-SBB is superposed with SAS-in-GPB, and SBB is superposed with NPBs of all other facets of self.(IIb) If SAS with its inseparable SBB resides in SBB then the OOBEr will experience two bodies: (a) SBB (below the neck) and (b) whole GPB; here SBB is not superposed with GPB, SAS-in-SBB is not superposed with SAS-in-GPB and SBB is not superposed with NPBs of all other facets of self. For example, yogi Satya Prakash Dubey (SPD)’s self resided in SBB during his OBE because he mentioned that he “saw”/experienced his whole GPB along with its surroundings.As per <(Carruthers, 2020) on “Who am I in Out of Body Experiences?…>, “Contemporary theories of self-consciousness typically begin by dividing experiences of the self into types, each requiring separate explanation. The stereotypical case of an out of body experience (OBE) may be seen to suggest a distinction between the sense of oneself as an experiencing subject, a mental entity, and a sense of oneself as an embodied person, a bodily entity. Point of view, in the sense of the place from which the subject seems to experience the world, in this case is tied to the sense of oneself as a mental entity and seems to be the ‘real’ self. Closer reading of reports, however, suggests a substantially more complicated picture. For example, the ‘real’ self that is experienced as separate from the body in an OBE is not necessarily experienced as disembodied. Subjects may experience themselves as having two bodies. In cases classed as heautoscopy [‘seeing one's own body at a distance’] there is considerable confusion regarding the apparent location of the experiencing subject; is it the ‘real mind’ in the body I seem to be looking out from, or is it in the body that I see? This suggests that visual point of view can dissociate from the experience of one’s own “real mind” or experience of self-identification. I provide a tripartite distinction between the sense of ownership, the sense of embodiment and the sense of subjectivity to better describe these experiences. The phenomenology of OBEs suggests that there are three distinct forms of self-consciousness which need to be explained.”[1] So far, only the facet # 43 of 54 facets of “self” survives death: [43] The ‘facet of the self related to genetic and recorded/published information during life’s salient work/karma/action,’ which includes genetic and epigenetic information passed on to future generations, information during teaching passed on to students, published papers/books/personal-views, online postings, contributions to the world, recorded good/bad actions (karmas), etc. This facet of self surely survives death because it has obvious scientific evidence (Online discussion in the scientific basis of consciousness, 2020).The self-as-subjective (“I”: experiencer, cognizer, and performer of actions) surviving death could be our wishful thinking unless we have strong evidence, based on scientific subjective and/or objective methodologies.  The ‘facet of the “self” related to genetic and work/karma-related recorded information’ is classified as the self-as-object (James’ “Me”). As per neuroscience, Karmic Effects also die during our death. As the universe dies, everything dies including the above facet of self.

What is your definition?...”- all over 40 meanings, say, a few“……“[1] the conceptual self, [2] the contextualized self, [3] the core self [(Damasio, 2010)], [4] the dialogic self, [5] the ecological self, [6] the embodied self, [7] the emergent self, [8] the empirical self, [9] the existential self, [10] the extended self [(Kim and Johnson, 2014)], ….”- are  assigned to the term \"consciousness by some mainstream philosophers;  and so are really completely meaningless “meanings” of the authors, who didn’t understand – what relations the notions “conceptual” “dialogic”  “ecological”, “empirical” have to a “self”? , to where/what these “selfs” are “embodied”?,  why are “existential”?, from where and for what sake emergent?,  extended? ; etc.Again in this thread – the phenomena/notions “Matter” and “Consciousness” can be, and are, scientifically defined only in framework of the Shevchenko-Tokarevsky’s “The Information as Absolute” conception https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260930711_the_Information_as_Absolute  DOI 10.5281/zenodo.268904,- more about what is Matter see the SS&VT informational physical model, for first reading see https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342600304_The_informational_physical_model_some_fundamental_problems_in_physics  DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.12325.73445,- about what is Consciousness see the SS&VT first approximation functional model https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329539892_The_Information_as_Absolute_conception_the_consciousness  DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.26091.18720.Matter – including practically material body+brain system, and “Consciousness”, including the human’s consciousness,  are – as that rigorously proven in the conception – for sure nothing else than some informational systems,- which – as any/every informational systems -  are made in accordance with the same absolutely fundamental Rules, Possibilities, etc. Including – see the last SS post above – the elements in a system have fundamentally obligatorily “selfs-awarenesses”, “feels”; they  understand messages inside the system, etc. – only provided this any system can exist as a system of elements.Nonetheless, in spite of both are made from one stuff “Information”, Matter and any Consciousness are fundamentally different systems, which operate in essentially different spacetimes, including the system “humans’ consciousness” operates critically outside Matter.So there is nothing surprised in observed, in some cases really existent/happening, some esoteric  events/effects, including reading of non-visible numbers, say, as that is in proposed experiment“…for investigating the underlying mechanism for “real” (100% disconnection) OBE on real-time basis and for testing the null hypothesis: the self-as-subject does not survive death….”- consciousness can act, and acts, outside brain; that is another thing, that now it is unknown in detail – how she does that.And in, mostly East, religions, and spiritual practices, there is a huge experience in this case.

The conclusion is that sensory awareness is a reaction on changes that can have a delay time up to 0,5 second. In other words, the consciousness that is related with changes in our direct surroundings “walks behind”. Other researchers have done comparable experiments too. Even experiments without an experimenter (all the measurement instruments and the experiment itself are “handled” by a computer program).In modern theoretical physics our universe is non-local. It means that everything is influences everything at exactly the same moment. In line with the experiments above that show that the body of a testee (test subject) shows a reaction just before the computer program changes the image on the display of the computer. A change of display that the testee must signal with the help of a push button.The concept of a non-local universe is not an attractive concept because it is complicating our thoughts about causality and therefore our ideas about logic. Nevertheless, entanglement between clear separated phenomena is a fact, if we like it or not.Introspection shows that consciousness is twofold. We can have strong feelings without much thoughts and we can have strong thoughts without much feelings. Feelings don’t change much in time. We don’t have a couple of different feelings in milliseconds. But there are experiments that show that we can have the experience of a large amount of thoughts within a couple of seconds.The question if consciousness exists inside or also outside the body is not so difficult to answer. First of all consciousness is a dynamical phenomenon. There is no consciousness if there are no internal and external changes.In modern theoretical physics observable/detectable reality is created by the structure of the basic quantum fields (QFT). That means that particles (matter) are compositions that represent local properties of these basic quantum fields.The consequence is that we cannot distinguish between the “material world” and the all-inclusive reality of the basic quantum fields. Especially because matter didn’t exist during the whole evolution of our universe. In the early universe there was a period without the existence of atoms but the basic quantum fields were present at that time. Moreover, the creation of matter in the universe resulted in the emerge of gravitation. Because without matter, there is no force of gravitation (Einstein 1920; Eric Verlinde 2011).The volume of our universe isn’t 100% dynamical because most of the volume is “occupied” by the universal scalar field, the Higgs field. Most of the volume of the universe is vacuum space and in vacuum space the Higgs field is 100% flat. Consciousness isn’t static, it is a dynamical phenomenon and that’s why I have to conclude that consciousness represents the properties of the electric and the corresponding magnetic field (the dynamical part of our universe). In other words, the idea that consciousness is the result of the physical existence of the human brain (matter) is “against nature”.With kind regards, Sydney","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"17th Jan, 2020","answer_content":"Please take a look at this useful RG link.Article Human Consciousness: Where Is It From and What Is It for ","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"6"},{"answer_post_date":"21st Feb, 2022","answer_content":"Maybe not everyone noticed the consequences of the experiment with the computer, described in my comment above. Because if the body of the testee (test person) signals the change of the picture on the display of the PC – just before the new picture is visible – what was the cause behind the detection?The computer program has instructions but it isn’t realistic to assume that the human body knows all the CPU instructions. But there is also a stream of data (the new picture) to the video memory. Next there is the video logic that is responsible for the transfer of the video data to the LCD display.But if the human body is aware of one of these changes inside the computer, why isn’t the PC system signalling a huge amount of other changes? Because everywhere around the testee are changes that can - in principle - be detected. For example, the measurement instruments for the muscle stress, hart rate, brain impulses, etc., have internal digital logic too.The only reasonable conclusion is that the testee, all the measurement instruments and the PC are together some kind of a semi-closed evolving “quantum mechanical configuration”. And the consciousness of the testee is part of it because if he is aware of a change of the image on the display he pushes the button.One can argue that the experiment doesn’t violate the concept that consciousness is just “data processing” in the brain. But this cannot be correct because in December 2001 there was an article in The Lancet about “Near-Death Experience in Survivors of Cardiac Arrest: A Prospective Study in the Netherlands” by Pim van Lommel, Van Wees, Meyers, Elfferich (DOI: 10.1016/S0140-6736(01)07100-8). Conclusion: there is consciousness “outside” the human body.Therefore if we like it or not, consciousness is a manifestation of the electric field and the corresponding magnetic field (basic quantum fields that exist at every \"point\" of the volume of the universe).

The body has different coping mechanisms to get rid of excess body heat, largely breathing, sweating, and increasing blood flow to the surface of the skin.cause for this is Increased ambient heat - Heat waves, humidity and Increased heat production - Overexertion, thyroid storm, malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, pheochromocytoma, delirium tremens, hypothalamic hemorrhage, toxic ingestions (eg, sympathomimetics, anticholinergics, MDMA).Causes of heat exhaustion include exposure to high temperatures, particularly when combined with high humidity, and strenuous physical activity. Without prompt treatment, heat exhaustion can lead to heatstroke, a life-threatening condition. Fortunately, heat exhaustion is preventable.Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a disorder characterized by extreme fatigue or tiredness that doesn't go away with rest and can't be explained by an underlying medical condition. CFS can also be referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID).Potential triggers include: Viral infections. Because some people develop chronic fatigue syndrome after having a viral infection, researchers question whether some viruses might trigger the disorder. Suspicious viruses include Epstein-Barr virus, human herpes virus 6 and mouse leukemia viruses.With fatigue, you have unexplained, persistent, and relapsing exhaustion. It's similar to how you feel when you have the flu or have missed a lot of sleep. If you have chronic fatigue, or systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID), you may wake in the morning feeling as though you've not sleptLow-grade fever is a common symptom in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome(CFS). Some additional symptoms, often associated with fatigue, should prompt an urgent visit to their doctor: Unexplained weight loss. New masses or lumps anywhere in the body. Fever, especially greater than 101 F (38.3 C).To be diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome, symptoms must last for at least six months. Unfortunately, in many people, symptoms persist for years. Symptoms tend to be worst in the first one to two years, and most people's level of functioning gradually improves over time.Activation of the sympathetic nervous system is known to increase core body temperature by increasing thermogenesis, including non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue, and by decreasing heat loss with peripheral vasoconstriction. psychological stress contributes to the development or exacerbation of low-grade fever in some CFS patients, possibly via sympathetic activation.

This especially becomes important if HMD is to be used over a prolonged period of time, like in typical training scenario. Some individuals get used to HMD conditions i.e. their symptoms of cybersickness go down with repeated exposure, however some never get over it, and it becomes a deal breaker for them. For example, we used Oculus Rift in one study with 25 subjects where each subject had 3 sessions with breaks in between (each session lasted for 15 minutes, and break was 10 min), and that was still causing not so suttle symptoms of cybersickness (headache, stomach awareness…) even with a population of extremely fit, over 22, all male subjects. I added a link to that study bellow.-- Note that navigation has 2 copmponents - (1) travel - this is motor component, and (2) wayfinidng - this is cognitive component (defined as a process of developing spatial knowledge and awareness of the surrounding space)— An additional line of literature that you would like to explore are studies that investigate the use of landmarks (local and global) in wayfinidng.— An additional issue that comes about in VR including immersive VR is judgment of distances that may affect navigation and wayfinding.— When searching for literature look for following keywords (in addition to HMD) “wayfinding”, “situational awareness”, “visual search task”, “presence”.Hope this helps.best,Amela--------- LINKS: -------------— Our study that used Oculus Rift:Brendan Geoghegan. “Navigational Heads-Up Display: Will a Shipboard Augmented Electronic Navigation System Sink or Swim?”, Master Thesis, Naval Postgraduate School (March 2015)https://calhoun.nps.edu/handle/10945/45191----- Papers on cyberskckness:J.

Galbraith traces a historical evolution of the dominant means of projecting power from condign through compensatory to conditioned methods. The evolution essentially proceeds from use of force of arms through payment for services to more or less sophisticated means of persuasion other than means in the first two categories. Naturally each of three means of projecting power always has been in use, usually in various interlocking forms; e.g. an ancient prince or a contemporary mining company operating in a developing country may hire a private army both to perform military missions and to condition a population to obey the principal's authority.The techniques developed by Edward Bernays in the 20th century to manipulate people at population-level are among the most outstanding achievements in the field of conditioned power.

Early in their respective lives each of Canetti and Bernays lived in Vienna. Each was Jewish. Each produced important works concerning mass psychology, in each case in connection with the work of Sigmund Freud. Whereas Bernays emigrated as an infant to the U.S. in 1892, Canetti experienced the National Socialist government is Austria, whereupon he emigrated to England in 1938, subsequently re-emigrating to Switzerland in 1972.Bernays' substantive field was business consulting. Canetti's was chemistry, whereby his real interest lay in literature.Bernays was a nephew of Sigmund Freud. He was instrumental in popularizing Freud's psychoanalytical works in the U.S., with significant social consequences for American society. Bernays' published numerous books on techniques for manipulating mass psychology, starting with Crystallizing Public Opinion (1923) and ending with Engineering of Consent (1955). His work is intensely practical. The question driving it is expressed in Propaganda (1928): \"If we understand the mechanism and motives of the group mind, is it not possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without their knowing it?”Canetti was an idealist rather than a practitioner. The question driving him was to understand the nature and being of human crowds. In Masse und Macht (1960) Canetti posited four generally applicable characteristics of a crowd (my own translation from the German; it will differ from the published English translation):While the motivations of Bernays and Canetti were quite different, each of them clearly recognized the peculiar susceptibility of crowds to manipulation by an agent who understands crowd behavior.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"3"},{"answer_post_date":"20th Jun, 2018","answer_content":"Philadelphia, PADear Lusk & readers,Very interesting comments on Bernays in particular--and we should recall the relationship between propaganda and mass marketing in 20th century history. I recall here a comment of a very famous and influential philosopher who I once got to know. He said that for a philosophy to prevail, it must rest upon (or perhaps draw upon) something already prevalent. The point seems to be highly relevant to the character of the \"power of persuasion.\" We want to be clear about the distinction between \"persuasion\" (or perhaps, \"rational persuasion\") on the one hand and manipulation on the other.  This, of course, might bring up the ancient topic of demagoguery--discussed, from ancient times under the heading of rhetoric. It seems that the contemporary problems of power and its abuse have much to do with the fact that rhetoric is now rarely taught, but marketing is very prevalently taught in the universities. Where does the topic of \"demagoguery\" come up in courses in mass marketing? Moreover, the techniques of mass marketing have entered strongly into political campaigns. Mass advertising is often ignored, of course. But it obviously has its effects, and the marketeers in business often seem to run the show regarding products on offer. Using the techniques of mass marketing in political contexts will amount to a kind of manipulative propaganda; and the worst instances of this kind of thing have been prominent in the totalitarian systems of the 20th century. Perhaps strengthening the laws on false or fraudulent advertising would have some positive effect? Fraud is a kind of private corruption. This is definitely part of this question. We want to know, in part, what \"corruption\" is,  and it belongs to that question to ask whether corruption can be private--in a firm or a market, say.

Despite its attractive aphoristic quality, I quickly concluded that there is no essential difference between public and private corruption.In support of this conclusion, some counterexamples may be mentioned.First, it is quite common for one sovereign government to defraud another sovereign government. In this category of cases it seldom is possible for a private citizen to be sure whether the apparently deceived sovereign actually was fooled or merely cooperated in the production of a common narrative for manufacturing the consent in relevant populations. The ghost of Bernays looms large in case of the seemingly deceptive means by which the U.S. induced the U.K., Canada, Australia and others to participate in its 2003 invasion of Iraq. It is highly unlikely that Her Majesty's government was deceived. The relatively hapless Australian government might have been deceived, but perhaps it was a fully complicit perpetrator and not a defrauded perpetrator-victim. Quite a number of people in Washington and Canberra must know the answer, but I do not.Secondly, a broader exploration reveals that each of governments, corporations and individuals are apt to defraud each of the others, and may combine in in various coalitions in order to do so.Thirdly, I am presently dealing with a Swiss case which illustrates a coalition of the kind just mentioned. It involves government agency A which pursues a debt claim on behalf of individual B against individual P in circumstances such that only individual Q possibly could have such a claim against P. It is a classical \"fraud triangle\". The question is whether P and Q should lodge a criminal information against A.It turns out that there is no merit in approaching the Swiss prosecutor. The reason is not that A is a government agency. It is because attempted fraud is not a criminal offense known to Swiss law.

However corrupt governments may be (I agree about collusion between the Bush administration and the U.K. government of the time--and the Iraq war.), it doesn't follow that there is no private corruption. In any case, let's try out some definitions of corruption, and see how they go.  According to Merriam Webster,Corruption is a matter of \"dishonest or illegal behavior, especially by powerful people,\" --including bribery, of course, but also other \"inducements by improper or unlawful means.\" ---end (sketch of) Webster's definitionNotice \"dishonest or illegal.\" Morality comes in. The forms of corruption likely make up an unending list, and the law sometimes runs to catch up. New forms continually evolve, as the older forms are exposed; but then the older forms are continually rediscovered somewhere or some-when else, so that they never die away completely. They do, however, tend to become more subtle and covert --harder to detect under pressure of exposures. Political scientist Michael Johnston (see his Syndromes of Corruption), says \"Corruption involves abuse of trust, generally one involving public power for private benefit.\"---end quotation\"Generally\" (but not exclusively) \"involving public power for private benefit.\"But notice that \"public power\" has become quite pervasive. Do agencies, such as the universities, which benefit from large-scale public support, exercise \"public power\"? How about advertising on public issues by large military contractors? Is this an exercise (potentially corrupt), of \"public power\"? Going back a century or more to the Gilded Age, the Pennsylvania Railroad (once the largest corporation in the world) was a private corporation, created by the state. (After New York built the Eire Canal.) Yet it was at the center of much 19th-century corruption, and regulation of the railroads, became a very large issue for the reformers. Are preferential pricing and tonnage rates not a kind of corruption? (As in favoritism to Rockefeller's Standard Oil?--ruining the competition) Or consider the British East India Company (or the Hudson's Bay company)--private firms or agencies of government?  In any case they could effectively govern, looking first to their own profits. Sometimes one will also find more limited definitions, e.g., political scientist, Samuel Huntington, in his Political Order in Changing Societies, p. 59: Corruption is behavior of public officials which deviates from accepted norms in order to serve private ends.---End quotationBut I submit that if the company treasurer embezzles funds, (or say, one partner in a partnership), then this trusted person \"deviates from accepted norms in order to serve\" particular private interests--not those defining the person's office and powers.

In this sense, the crowd is similar to an excitable medium with non-linear response characteristics. Reading Canetti, we can also conclude that the lower form of social organization, described as a pack, is just as important, especially as a seed of corruption; one can even conclude that corruption is the natural property of a pack.

This is an argument often made about the fall of the Roman Republic. The extension of Roman power around the Mediterranean world produced sever factionalism, internal conflict and finally civil war in the Roman republic. Various powerful men used the resources of the provinces against each other. The citizens were unable to restore order, by the customary means, and the republic was then replace by the empire. The image I have of this is of the republic declining into a warring, or conflict ridden, oligarchy which was afterward replaced by submission to Augustus.

Nothing in the definition limits the scope of the concept to the public sphere. A characteristic, but not necessary, element of the phenomenon is that the malfeasor is in a position of power. The particular position which confers power could be public position or a private position.If we consider the public-private distinction in relation to position power with J.K. Galbraith's framework, we notice that both public position power and private position power confer opportunities to wield the full gamut of condign, compensatory and conditioned power.Fraud is a very specific form of corruption. It is a criminal offense involving obtaining unlawful enrichment for oneself or another by means of deception. It is clear that both public and private actors are capable of committing the offense. Fraud may be institutionalized, in which case it is not prosecuted. The U.S. and English fractional reserve banking systems are outstanding examples of institutionalized private fraud. \"By deception thou shalt do war\", the official motto of Mossad, points to a field of institutionalized public fraud.I also agree with your observation that private corruption facilitates political corruption. Your illustration of the phenomenon by reference to the reconstitution of the Roman Republic as the Roman Empire seems correct to me.The latter example should be taken to heart in light of contemporary events. Consider, for example, the continuing efforts by some parts of the U.S. military-industrial complex and of some parts of the official U.S. government to realize the essentially imperial objectives of the Project for an New American Century. A few commentators, such as Professor Michel Chossudovsky, write extensively on this subject. However, I do not detect much evidence that the public is attentive to the matter notwithstanding that a substantial proportion of the public knows about it. The public generally is not attentive in this respect because it is conditioned not to be attentive.

On the contrary, there is a good deal of evidence that it has made the public more susceptible to corporatist mass-media manipulation. The complaints about foreign, internet-mediated, interference in domestic election campaigns is a case in point. Of course, the internet has made the public more attentive to the charms of adorable cat pictures, etc --and various other trivial matters. Crucial matters are often drowned in the floods of (often useless or distracting) information. There is a positive side, of course, since it has proved possible for people with similar interests to find and communicate with each other. But it has not, apparently allowed for their effective organization. Consider the roles of electronic media in the chiefly ill-fated \"Arab Spring.\"Of course, we discount conspiracy theories which are often completely off the wall, empirically unsupported, and pretty wild. Much more plausible will be accounts of the same problems in terms of a chiefly uncoordinated confluence of various and distinct interests. No one planned the contemporary prevalence and power of the lobbying firms on K Street, for instance. Its more a matter of various actors, with quite distinct interests following a successful model of influencing legislation. Its the prevalence and intensiveness of this pattern which is problematic, even where there is nothing illegal in it. Much the same could be said for the untoward influence of large donors in election campaigns. No one planned and coordinated this. It arose quite naturally, as one might put it, as a consequence of the power of federal funding and favoritism. Its the extent and intensity of the influence which is problematic, especially since it tends to undermine public trust in government \"for the people.\" Regarding the consolidation of the financial markets, I recommend the following article from the Atlantic: Simon Johnson, \"The Quiet Coup\":See:https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/05/the-quiet-coup/307364/Have a look.

Fractional reserve banking no longer fulfills all of the elements of the criminal offense of fraud. There are two reasons for this: institutionalization and conditioning.One element of fraud is unlawful enrichment. In many jurisdictions, it is a criminal offense to operate a pyramid selling scheme, being a particular form of fraud. Supposing the legislature of such a jurisdiction were to amend the law so as to provide that it is permissible to operate a pyramid selling scheme. From the moment that amendment takes effect, operating a pyramid selling scheme no longer would be fraudulent, since the enrichment thereby yielded no longer would be unlawful. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 is precisely such a law. It institutionalized fractional reserve banking in the U.S.Another element of fraud is deception. Especially since the Global Financial Crisis borrowers in financial markets have become aware of - or have been \"conditioned\", to use J. K. Galbraith's terminology - to accept the fraudulent mechanism. To the extent that a borrower is advised in advance that the lending bank will deliver nothing of value in exchange for the borrower's promise to make a series of \"repayments\" of the putative principal and interest payments based on the putative principal, the borrower is not deceived. Without deception, the offense of fraud is not complete.Fractional reserve banking necessarily causes periodic financial crises or collapses. It is during such crises that fractional reserve banking is most profitable for a commercial bank - provided that it has a reasonably strong balance sheet - and correspondingly most catastrophic for borrowers. Precisely such situations at macroeconomic level are the business focus of the Bretton Woods institutions.Would you please specify the \"old economic theory\" to which you refer? I am also curious to know in which respect you say I \"go too far\" in criticizing the fractional reserve banking system.It is nowadays commonplace and even fashionable to deplore financialization of the real economy. Financial regulators persist in permitting emission of derivative financial products so complex that neither the emitting institutions, the market participants nor the regulators themselves are capable of accurately quantifying the corresponding market risk. The main regulatory approach is to promulgate regulatory rules of corresponding complexity. The result - and presumably the goal - is that it frequently is impossible to determine whether or not an emitting institution's financial products comply with applicable law. The ensuing proliferation of vastly complex and intractable regulatory issues serves as a theatrical property for distracting electorates from the simple underlying problem: i.e. the fractional reserve banking system.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"22nd Jun, 2018","answer_content":"First, I agree with Karl Pfeifer that talk of absolutes in political theory is incoherent.  But the relation of power to corruption is a real and important issue.  I had always taken for granted that there is a definite relation until I stumbled upon the book \"A Cloud Across the Pacific: Essays on the Clash between Chinese and Western Political Theories Today,\" by Thomas A. Metzger.  It has been more than decade since I read some parts of it, but if memory serves, Metzger makes the point that Chinese political theory did not begin with the standard view in the West, namely that humans are inevitably prone to corruption unless law or other external agent restricts individual behavior.  The Chinese view is that a leader who follows the teachings of Confucius can overcome ordinary human frailty through disciplines and practices to cultivate wisdom.   The wise ruler then stands above corruption and thus above the need for law.  Whereas Western political philosophy has focused on the need to construct a fence made of laws and countervailing power around the ambitious ruler, the Chinese approach has been to emphasize self-cultivation through reflection.   Without claiming that the Chinese model worked perfectly from the Tang to the Qing dynasties, the civil service there was probably less corrupt than the court of any Western ruler.  Thus, the aspirational quality of Chinese thought should not be dismissed as being naive, just because it does not align with Western cynicism.

The most charitable interpretation of it might be that the less limitation there is on political power, the more probable it becomes that it will be abused.However, there is also a psychological insight in Acton's dictum if we think of it in terms of *thinking* absolutely - in other words, maintaining a belief (in this case about one's power, or about those one has power over) to which no possible alternatives are considered apart from the negation of that belief. Those who *believe* in their power absolutely are also corrupted by it into not considering the humanity of others and treating them in an entirely instrumental way that short-circuits moral reflection.

Of course, there is a long tradition of \"self-cultivation\" in the West, too --the attainment of the virtues is a central theme of Aristotle's Ethics. This leads him to the concept of \"aristocracy,\" (\"rule by the best\") though he warns in the Politics, that oligarchy is a degenerate, or deviant (one might be tempted to translate the Greek by \"corrupt\") form of aristocracy, in which self-interest and selfish ends pre-dominate, and the common good is ignored. As a corrective to this danger he puts forward the idea of a society dominated by the middling sorts. One recalls that western aristocracies have often attempted to rule chiefly in their own self-interest. Given the centralized power of the contemporary Chinese state, there would seem to be some similar danger of a \"new class.\" \"Personality\" does matter, or, I would prefer to say character matters.

English Kings ruled by divine right, placing them in a position analogous to that of the Pope. At least in theory, an English King was checked and balanced by God Almighty; hence there was no need for His Majesty to be checked and balanced by a parliament and constitutional courts.Lord Acton's particular horror was reserved for the doctrine of papal infallibility, which he strenuously opposed.

On the contrary, we can understand Aristotle's Ethics as a program for \"happiness\" (eudaimonia) and well being (its almost literally \"good spiritness\"). But the etymology is less important than understanding the virtues and how they are acquired. He argues that we attain to the best life by means of self-constraint which is required to moderate the passions in accordance with the development of reason and a proper understanding--say of the character of our choices and habits. To attain to the virtues, one must first resist the extremes to which one is most inclined. His ethical ideals then enter into his political ideas with the warning that aristocracy, \"rule by (virtuous) the best\" tends to degenerate into oligarchy; and Aristotle hardly distinguishes \"oligarchy\" from corrupt plutocracy --rule by the rich (who are always few) for their own benefit alone --and which ignores the common good. I think people would say, in contemporary terms, that in the \"degenerate\" forms, greed takes over from \"our better angels.\" In contemporary democracies, the prevalent view is that the people themselves are the best judge of their own interests, and that is one reason why we are generally skeptical of aristocracy. Aristotle saw clearly that a large and prosperous middle class was need to check the power of the rich few. He calls such a system \"polity.\" That Lord Acton was Catholic does not show that he was not a liberal. \"Liberal Catholic\" is no contradiction in terms. Of course, there was a grand international reaction against the Pope declaring himself \"infallible\" --\"in matters of faith and morals.\" (This was in the late 19th century, a particularly conservative Pope, as I recall.) This included some Catholic reaction. Acton didn't think much of un-checked kings, either. I am not convinced that Acton was no liberal. However, the question could presumably be settled by text or quotation. The fame of the dictum has much to do, I suspect, with the British Protestants saying, in effect, \"See even the great Catholic agrees!\" But whoever liked the dictum or didn't in past centuries, it stands on its own legs.

This was a decision in favor of very large banks, developed through take-overs and consolidations, which were thought to be needed for globalized competition. The idea was, partly, that if the Europeans, have gigantic international banking firms, then we need to have them, too. But this amounted to a very large concentration of economic power in comparatively few hands. (I think that in some ways, we are not as good at regulation.) The Dodd-Frank legislation afterward attempted new regulation. However, there has also been a significant financialization of the U.S. economy, meaning that a larger share of total GNP comes from finance. Many fear the consequences of financial firms, \"too big to fail,\" --meaning they would substantially take the entire economy down with them, and would therefore require very-large scale bailouts of the sort we saw following the 2008 crash. Its a \"moral hazard\" of bigness. Looking back to the progressive era, at the start of the 20th century--but which we might see as culminating with FDR's policies--the basic division was between those who wanted to allow gigantic concentrations, \"trusts,\" and \"monopolies,\" and regulate them, and those who wanted to break up the larger firms into smaller, mutually competing firms. One danger in bigness, of course, is \"policy capture.\" Insisting on smaller units, in contrast, is a kind of \"divide and conquer\" policy of big finance, in the public interest. A further danger of great financial concentrations is that there may be undue or inappropriate influence on investment policies. The big firms may hold too much power over other businesses, or, they may unduly favor speculative foreign investments and international financial markets, in contrast to the evaluation of the economic basics of prospective domestic borrowers. We might also expect that wealth may be increasingly concentrated on the coasts, (say, New York City, San Francisco, Charlotte, to the neglect of (so-called) \"fly-over\" America.  We notice here in the city, that following the Clinton \"reforms\" and the wave of consolidations in finance, the larger, hometown based banks of Philadelphia, which originated and developed in the city were gone.

I've had some discussions of his work --some years back: The theme was technological imperatives. As I recall, this has much to do with people jumping on the bandwagon of, let us say \"the next big thing,\" whatever it may be. The idea of our need to take responsibility was largely rejected in those discussions. \"A.I.\" say, is inevitable, to update the theme, \"so you might as well get aboard.\" All caution and self-constraint are typically cast to the wind. Not unrelated, I suspect is the famous thesis of the \"inevitability of oligarchy,\" sometimes cast in the form of Robert Michels, \"Iron law of Oligarchy\"--from his book of 1911, Political Parties.  To resist the abuse of power, I think, one must take precautions, and this is inhibited by the tendency to go along, and the excesses of competitiveness--seeking out any possible advantage to get ahead. But more strictly, oligarchy is not inevitable, and technological imperatives can be resisted or moderated. Where there's a will, there's a way. But as with the corrupting tendency of power, the will to resist is often absent, and the know-how, too. This includes social, organizational methods. The easiest thing to do is simply jump on the moving bandwagon--maybe finding out where it is going much later. Few want to take responsibility--to paraphrase Ellul. Why is it so difficult? Basically, to find out how to act responsibly, one must want to learn how, and, too often, other matters are pressing. H.G.

Totalitarisme culturel dont le totalitarisme politique n’est que la conclusion plus ou moins nécessaire. Si celui-ci ne contrôle pas encore la totalité de l’espace-temps terrestre, celui-là est en train d’imposer un seul type de culture, de mode de vie et de pensée à la quasi-totalité de la planète. » Bernard CHARBONNEAU [1980]My traduction:''All revolts, and particularl this one, is a ''no'' to the social condition, and this one is more radical because it is not against a current state or current church, but against a world which tend to constitute itself into a system, technically, economically and finally as a state, a burocracy, military and police state, where noting would escape the eye or the hand of Leviathan.  Cultural totalitarism whose political totalitarism is only a consequence more or less necessary.  If this leviathan does not yet control the totality of of the time space on earth, is it imposing a unique type of culture, way of life, way of thinking on the whole planet.''  Bernard Charbonneau.Many thinkers have warned us against the rise of a global totalitarism, a global leviathan on this planet.  Tockqueville suspected some lurking totalitarism that would emerge from the democratic order, that would stem from a generalized apathy generated by confort and convenience and a hidden desire we have to be secured and protected and our fear to face the challenge of freedom. Lewis Mumford reviewed the whole human history from the rise of the first civilisation from the perspective of the rise of increasing totalitarian megamachines.  I see a lot of common ideas with Ellul.  I was impressed with the speech of the Dictator by Charly Chaplin and by his famous car factory scene in ''Modern Time''.  Here we see the gradual instrumentalisation by the very apparatus supposed to serve us.  I am particularly sensitive to the role of money and finance in human history from the first agrarian civilisation.  The role of the religions for protecting societies against the market and money.   Christianity in the west has been very effective for a thousand years.  We see it being subverted gradually by money and the different phase of reformations that faciliate commerce and money.  We see the re-apparition of slavery, one ultimate form of submission of human to economic ends.  We see the modern democracy being put in place in the name of a collective will but from the very beginning serving powerfull financial banking interests at the root of all colonisation and the modern international trades.  Wars always accelerated the rise of the megamachine and the demise of institutions protecting the dignity of human life. the dystopian vision of the future that Mumford warned of:\"The beleaguered– even 'obsolete'–individual would be entirely de-skilled, reduced to a passive, inert, 'trivial accessory to the machine.' Technical surveillance and limitless data-collection—'an all-seeing eye' (Panopticon)—would monitor every 'individual on the planet. Ultimately, the totalitarian technocracy, centralizing and augmenting its 'power-complex,' ignoring the real needs and values of human life, might produce a world 'fit only for machines to live in'\" . .. \"...I have been driven, by the wholesale miscarriage of megatechnics, to deal with the collective obsessions and compulsions that have misdirected our energies, and undermined our abilities to live full and spiritually satisfying lives.\"   ...\"But for those of us who have thrown off the myth of the machine, the next move is ours: for the gates of the technocratic prison will open automatically, despite their rusty ancient hinges, as soon as we choose to walk out.\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Machine","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"24th Jun, 2018","answer_content":"No human being will have absolute power of anything, and if there is one, then that is abuse of the term power.

You may need to read the full article, \"The Ponzi State,\" or turn to Packer's later book, The Unwindinding, but I though the following short passage illustrates the character of the kind of \"control\" fraud Bill Black wrote about. The point here is to understand \"accounting control fraud.\" Packer tells of what was uncovered by a Florida investigative reporter, named Van Sickler: One night in December, Van Sickler took me on a tour of some of the abandoned and foreclosed properties that had once belonged to Sonny Kim’s real-estate empire. We stopped at an ill-lit corner in a mostly black slum of single-family houses called Belmont Heights, which is cut off from downtown Tampa by Interstate 4. Van Sickler—incongruous-looking in a dress shirt and dark slacks—pointed out a decaying two-story stucco house. Its windows were boarded up, and mattresses lay in the overgrown yard, near a “For Sale” sign. Van Sickler learned that Kim acquired the house in 2006 with a deed that was witnessed by a convicted drug dealer, then flipped it for the sum of three hundred thousand dollars, with the help of a no-money-down mortgage from a subsidiary of Washington Mutual Bank, which later foreclosed on the house. (Last year, WaMu went into receivership, after becoming the largest bank failure in American history.) According to mortgage-fraud experts, the straw buyer is typically paid a small slice of the flipper’s take and then disappears without moving in. When Van Sickler recently asked a real-estate agent about the house, he was told, “That’s selling for fifty-two thousand, but it can be yours for thirty-five thousand in cash.” ---End quotationSee:https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/02/09/the-ponzi-stateBy the way, you can find some of Van Sickler's writings on line. The chief question here is why the bank would make the mortgage loan on a house, often sight unseen, allowing Kim to buy for very small sums and then resell for $300,000? (Kim was later prosecuted and convicted, but the others, including those who approved the loan were not prosecuted.) Part of the answer seems to be that the bank management was making large bonuses, by the volume of the mortgages made, and no on was checking on the qualifications of the buyer (often not even on the identity of the buyer) or the actual value of the property. The executives at the bank didn't want to slow down the process and could order the bank's accountants to ignore the details. Another part of the answer is that the banks did not plan on keeping the mortgages on their own books. Instead, groups of mortgages were packaged as mortgaged-backed \"securities,\" and sold on to other investors in the large-scale finance markets. The firms selling such overvalued securities, included all the greatest banks and finance companies in the western world--both domestic to the U.S. and many foreign firms as well. No one really checked on the value or risks involved, including firms which \"guaranteed\" or insured the securities, until after the entire scheme began to fall apart in the crash of 2008.  Questions, does \"absolute\" financial\" power produce \"absolute\" corruption? What is the character of these so-called \"lords of creation\" --running great international banks? If this is the institutional linch-pin of globalization, then what does this great consolidation of power promise the world? It appears that the regulators have either been \"captured\" --or, what is perhaps more plausible, they simply weren't able to keep up with the rush of transactions and events --too big, too fast.

Amazed at the sight, he descended into the opening, where, among other marvels, he beheld a hoolow brazen horse, haing doors, at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature, as appeared to him, more than human, and having nothing on but a gold ring; this he took from the finger of the dead and re ascended. Now the shepherds met together, according to custom, that they might send their monthly report about the flocks to the king; into their assembly he came having the ring on his finger, and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand, when instantly he became invisible to the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were no longer present. He was astonished at this, and again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared; he made several trials of the ring, and always with the same result-when he turned the collet inwards he became invisible, when outwards he reappeared. Whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court; where as soon as he arrived he seduced the queen, and with her help conspired against the king and slew him, and took the kingdom.. Suppose now that there were two such magic rings, and the just put on one of them and the unjust the other; no man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would satnd fast in justice.. No man would keep his hands off what was not his own when  he could safely take what he liked out of the market, or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure, or kill or release from prison whom he would, and in all respects be like a God among men. Then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust; they would both come at last to the same point. And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just, not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust, there he is unjust. For all men believe in their hearths that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice, and he who argues as I have been supposing, will say that they are right. If you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible, and never doing any wrong or touching what was another’s, he would be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although they would praise him to one another’s faces, and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer inuustice.’’‘’If Plato’s allegory of the ring is right, then we had better watch out. Anyone who gains power without accountablility is liable to use it unjustly. This particularly significant right now as the U.S. and U.K. governments are increasing the secrecy of their actions and gaining increased power over public information such as news, Secrecy is a form of invisibility, and for the purpose of power, as effective as a magic ring.’’https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/Philosophers/Plato/plato_dialogue_the_ring_of_gyges.htmlTolkien's hobbit and the Lord of the Rings is a similar tale on a ring of power providing invisibility.

I agree with Yurii, but equilibrium can also be ensured by modifying the rate constants appropriately. Thinking about activity coefficients (g), they essentially cause an increase/decrease in chemical potential energy (u):u = u0 + RT ln {A}   = u0 + RT ln (g) + RT ln [A]   = u0 + /\\u + RT ln [A]Where /\\u = RT ln(g), so g = exp( /\\u /RT)Now the rate equation kind of accounts for energy with the rate constant, and collision frequency in the concentration term (please help me out here). If I use activities and the Arrhenius equation:r = k{A}   = k0 * exp(-E/RT) * g * [A]   = k0 * exp(-E/RT) * exp( /\\u /RT) * [A]   = k0 * exp(-(E - /\\u )/RT) * [A]So by using activities, you essentially reduce the activation energy required by the same amount as the chemical potential energy is changed by the activity coefficient.

We are counting the number of reacted species A in the react A -> B. Therefore the rate = d[A]/dt. The reaction rate law can be written as d[A]/dt = -k’[A] or d[A]/dt= -k{A}. The second expression is theoretically correct and suggest that k is constant. However, you can’t integrate this equation. Therefore, we should write d[A]/dt = -k g [A], where g is the activity coefficient of A and k’ = kg. Finally you have d[A]/dt = -kg[A] and d[A]/[A] = -kg dt.As a result, experimentally you are dealing with kg, which is dependent on experimental conditions (ionic strength, solvent, etc.). Therefore, Dankwerts’ statement is intrinsically contradictive.

It’s related to the “thermodynamics of irreversible systems.”","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"28th Aug, 2014","answer_content":"The form suggested by classic transition-state theory (going back to Eyring, 1935, J. Chem. Phys. 3, 107-115) indicates that one should use activities, not concentrations. That is what we do (largely) in my field of aqueous geochemistry. In simulating the interaction of aqueous solution with minerals, it is important that the rate equations be consistent with equilibrium as an end point (that is, the rate goes to zero as equilibrium is approached). That is doubtless important in other areas as well. Nevertheless, rate laws written in terms of concentration are common. By the way, de Donder seems to have been the purveyor of the affinity concept, although the notion of activities predates that. Since Tobias Louw brought up the activity coefficient of the activated complex, it is common belief (as stated in textbooks and such) that the rate of the decomposition of the activated complex to products is proportional to the concentration, not the activity of the the activated complex. This particular issue is considered \"settled science\" owing to analysis of experiments involving aqueous ions, particularly ones of high charge number. A specific reference to this topic is given by Laidler, 1965, Chemical Kinetics, 2nd edition, McGraw -Hill, New York. See pages 221-223, especially Fig. 50. This is regarded as the \"proof\" in favor of concentration. I can tell you that the impression of good fit is in part due to not showing all the actual data points given by the cited sources of the data. In defense of Laidler and many others who present similar plots, this is likely done only to achieve clarity for pedagogical purposes. A key point is that the same slopes result from either theory (concentration or activity). Significant difference in slope would only result from reactions involving highly charged species of the same charge sign. So perhaps the analysis in favor of concentration is wrong. Perhaps the people in the plasma world would weigh in? ","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"28th Aug, 2014","answer_content":"@Yannick: I agree we cannot determine Tau without calculations, and using activities with a value for Tau which was experimentally determined for use with concentrations is incorrect. However, Tau will depend on the non-ideality of the solution. I'm looking for an expression which will yield an (experimentally obtained) Tau which is independent of composition.@Yurii: I am interested in the reversible reaction. In transition state theory, one of the assumptions is that the reaction only proceeds in one direction from the activated state, thus my expression [AB]*->[P]. I also believe that the concept of activities is not exclusive to classical thermodynamics, but it has a solid foundation in statistical mechanics. It can and definitely should be applied to non-equilibrium systems.@Thomas: I completely agree that this should be \"settled science\", that's why I'm surprised to find so many different opinions on the subject :). On the point of end-point equilibrium: let's use the reaction [A]+[B] <-> [AB]* <-> [P]. Just substituting activities in place of concentrations would yield the following:d[A]/dt = kf{A}{B} - kr{P} = kf(gA)(gB)[A][B] - kr(gP)[P]Where gi are the activity coefficients. On the other hand, if we use transition state theory (TST), we should use:d[A]/dt = kf(gA)(gB)/(gAB*) [A][B] - kr(gP)/(gAB*) [P]At equilibrium, the activity coefficient of the activated complex will cancel, so both expressions result in the same end-point equilibrium.However, (gAB*) will affect the actual rates. If we follow TST, then it does become a question, just as Thomas said, of whether we believe the rate is proportional to the activity or the concentration of the activated state. According to TST, the rate of product formation (rp) is given by:rp = k[AB]*In this expression, \"k = Kappa*v\" where \"v\" is the frequency of vibration of the activated state along the reaction coordinate and Kappa accounts for the fact that every oscillation doesn't result in product formation. If Kappa is independent of the solution, then the use of concentrations in \"rp = k[AB]*\" is appropriate, since we are dealing with actual amounts, as opposed to the \"apparent\" amounts which are represented by activities. So, is there any reason to believe that Kappa will be dependent on the chemical potential energy of the activated state?","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"30th Aug, 2014","answer_content":"Dear Colleagues,Let’s look at the question from the practical point of view.No doubt that the rate is measured as d[C]/dt (in concentrations). The reaction rate law must be written in concentrations, otherwise you will be unable to simulate the kinetics. In this case the reaction rate constants are not constant and depend on ionic strength, solvent, etc. Now we want to link the kinetics to the classic thermodynamics. In the classic thermodynamics the deviations from ideal systems are described by introducing the activity coefficients. In classic thermodynamics all reactions are reversible, otherwise you have deltaG = infinity. All thermodynamic equations are written using activities, which are g[C]. The kinetics and thermodynamics are linked to each other through equilibrium constants. Therefore the reaction rate laws expressed in [C] include the activity coefficients, the rate constant k for the ideal system becomes gk.Thomas correctly wrote that “The form suggested by classic transition-state theory (going back to Eyring, 1935, J. Chem. Phys. 3, 107-115) indicates that one should use activities, not concentrations.” At the same time “It is common belief (as stated in textbooks and such) that the rate of the decomposition of the activated complex to products is proportional to the concentration, not the activity of the activated complex.” I agree with Thomas that “So perhaps the analysis in favor of concentration is wrong.” Here are my thoughts.I mentioned several times that all reactions should be written as reversible, but if the equilibrium is shifted to the right hand side, we simplify kinetic analysis assuming that the rate of reverse reaction is too slow. Nevertheless, for the accurate analysis all reactions should be written as reversibleThe Tobias equation d[A]/dt = kf(gA)(gB)/(gAB*) [A][B] - kr(gP)/(gAB*) [P] is not correctIt should be d[A]/dt = -kf(gA)(gb)[A][B] + kb [AB*] andd[AB*]/dt = kf(gA)(gb)[A][B] – (kb - kp)[AB*] + k-p(gP)[P],If the steady-state is applicable, then [AB*] = ( kf(gA)(gb)[A][B] + k-p(gP)[P] )/ (kb -kp) andd[A]/dt = -kf(gA)(gb)[A][B] + ( kb /(kb -kp) ) ( kf(gA)(gb)[A][B] + k-p(gP)[P] ) = ( kp /(kb-kp) ) ( kf(gA)(gb)[A][B] + k-p(gP)[P] )Thus, an additional term ( kp /(kb-kp) ) appears in the rate law.At equilibrium d[A]/dt =0, and [P]/[A][B] = ( kp /(kb-kp) ) ( kf(gA)(gb)/ k-p(gP) If the reaction is thermodynamically very favorable, kb << kp, then d[A]/dt = - kf(gA)(gb)[A][B], and K(eq) = kf(gA)(gb)/k-p(gP).If the reaction deltaG is very small, then kb ~ kp and d[AB*]/dt = kf(gA)(gb)[A][B] – (kb - kp)[AB*] + k-p(gP)[P]This gives K ~ kf(gA)(gb)/k-p(gP).Thus, if the reaction rates of activated complex are expressed in concentration, then kb and kp are present in all equations. However, at small and very high deltaG, they are neither present in equilibrium constants nor in the reaction rate laws. I do not use the term “Kappa”, therefore I can’t answer Tobias question.Here, we do not discuss the thermodynamics of irreversible systems, where the kinetics is directly implanted into the theory.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"29th Nov, 2021","answer_content":"Expecting to help in this engaging discussion, some thoughts based on my experience are:","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"4th Jan, 2022","answer_content":"At the risk of not adding a lot to the conversation and speculating about someone's thought process, an possibly being spectacularly wrong,  I will point out the final bit of the Danckwerts quote has two parts: 1) This formulation is misconceived in principle and 2) and in practice the use of concentrations usually leads to somewhat better results that the use of activities. I would suggest that this second part may have been the key take-home point at the time. Given the state of computing, data availability, analytic techniques, etc. one would be better served by using the concentration approach.  For part one, I must confess I don't quite follow why the term misconceived was used - the discussion of Dr. Geletii and others seems correct to me.  Perhaps though the key is in the previous sentence which states that \"the  corresponding rate-constant will then be independent of composition\" is the problem.

In the hope that the disciplinary complementarity may be useful in line with its objectives.The dialogue between sex and gender has evolved in parallel with the transformations that have historically taken place in the relations between men and women. In 1955, based on the ideas of John Money, the gender approach appeared as a theory in psychology. Psychologists wondered why there were people who behaved strangely from a sexual point of view, who did not correspond to what was expected and who did not conform either to culture or to the norms established by society.Later, other thinkers reflected on these issues and revealed that different societies and cultures develop particular ways of being a woman and a man, which they called gender. They not only took into account psychological aspects, but also recognised the existence of both sexes at the same time, all of which are able to characterise individuals with specific qualities that are defined by the fact of being born female or male. Therefore, the term gender or gender relations refers to the attributes, values and practices assigned to men and women in a society.From the second half of the 20th century onwards, the traits of femininity and masculinity began to be seen more and more strongly as the result of the assignment of roles or functions to each of the sexes by society. In this way, the term gender, which initially had a purely grammatical use, became a category used by the social sciences to study the differences between men and women.The recognition of the importance of gender in public policy, and its consequences, is something of transcendence in recent decades, which has implied an arduous task for non-governmental organisations concerned with the recognition of women's rights. Currently, the term gender is used to indicate the set of differentiated characteristics that each society assigns to women and men, which are vital because they define people's existence, that is, they are not formal particularities, but behaviours, ways of acting and thinking that give meaning to life and determine to a large extent their existence.Sorry if the content does not relate to your question, and apologies for the length. RegardsFernando  Estimado Pasi, me tomo el atrevimiento de hacer mención a algunos elementos de las ciencias sociales en relación al enfoque de género, y a los conceptos feminidad y masculinidad. Con el deseo que la complementariedad disciplinaria, pueda ser de utilidad en línea con sus objetivos.El diálogo entre sexo y género ha evolucionado paralelamente a las transformaciones que se han operado históricamente en las relaciones entre varón y mujer. En 1955, a partir de las ideas de John Money, el enfoque de género aparece como una teoría de la psicología. Los psicólogos se preguntaban por qué había personas que tenían comportamientos extraños desde el punto de vista sexual, que no se correspondían con lo esperado y que no se ajustaban ni a la cultura ni a las normas establecidas por la sociedad.Posteriormente, otros pensadores reflexionaron sobre estos temas y develaron que las diferentes sociedades y culturas desarrollan formas particulares de ser mujer y de ser hombre, a esas formas le llamaron género. No sólo tomaron en cuenta los aspectos psicológicos, también reconocieron la existencia de los dos sexos, al mismo tiempo, todo lo cual es capaz de caracterizar a los individuos con cualidades específicas que se definen según el hecho de haber nacido hembra o macho. Por tanto, el término género o las relaciones de género hace referencia a los atributos, valores y prácticas asignados a hombres y mujeres en una sociedad.A partir de la segunda mitad del siglo XX empieza a considerarse, cada vez con más fuerza, que los rasgos propios de la feminidad y la masculinidad obedecen a la asignación de roles o funciones de cada uno de los sexos por parte de la sociedad. De esta manera, la expresión género, que en un principio tenía un uso meramente gramatical, pasó a convertirse en una categoría utilizada por las ciencias sociales para el estudio de las diferencias entre varón y mujer.El reconocimiento de la importancia del tema del género dentro de las políticas públicas, y sus consecuencias, es algo de transcendencia en las últimas décadas, que implico una ardua tarea de las organizaciones no gubernamentales que se ocupan del reconocimiento de los derechos de la mujer. En la actualidad, se utiliza el término género para señalar el conjunto de características diferenciadas que cada sociedad asigna a las mujeres y a los hombres, son vitales porque definen la existencia de las personas, es decir, no son particularidades de tipo formal, sino conductas, formas de actuar y pensar que dan sentido a la vida y determinan en gran parte su existencia.Perdón si el contenido no se relaciona a su pregunta, y disculpas por la extensión.

That is why I wanted to know, if there are other scholars than myself and Riane Eisler, who consider gender as socially constructed within the modalities set up by the biological attractors that are tuned up by hormones and genes. I do not mean biological essentialism, I mean the application of chaos theory and the concept of attractors to the construction of gender.If you do not know examples of such tradition, could you possibly point out some  dominant works of gender studies, which led to the almost complete ignorance of biologal factors in the theories of gender? Or do you possibly know any good references to texts in which scholars of gender studies conclude that biology is relatively insignificant and that all the measured differences between \"testodriven\" and \"estrodriven\" persons socially constructed (and that the tendency of women, to become socially less skillful if they receive big quantities of testosterone, is also socially constructed).One interesting thread of discussion might be the construction of homosexuality. It feels a bit controversial to claim that gender is 100% socially constructed (meaning that gender can be changed during one's lifetime) while homosexuality would be 100% biologically constructed (meaning that it cannot be easily changed to heterosexuality during one's lifetime).

This may be associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death due to triggered activity and malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The contractile dysfunction observed in PVC-induced cardiomyopathy could be explained by an altered calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

These processes, which are unfavorable for the economic development of the country, usually have at least several causes.Extending the average life expectancy of citizens results from improved living standards, increased income and related improvements in quality of life, improvement of nutrition and improvement in the health care services sector. In addition, some of the lowly, educated people go to look for more interesting jobs and higher salaries by hiring in other countries. In a situation where young people paying off housing loans, are also burdened with various taxes, they are forced to work, to professional activity all adult members of the family of working age.As a result, the pressure, the need to have more than 1 or 2 children are decreasing, and then the fertility decreases, which contributes to the decline in the number of citizens in the long term. In order to counteract this disadvantage for the national economy, this country should develop social policy to support young people, including subsidizing the purchase or rental of housing, establishing guaranteed income related to raising children, developing programs supporting the nursery, pre-school and education, pediatric health care system, etc.Examples of such programs of active socio-economic policy are: Family 500 Plus Program and Flat Plus Program (Mieszkanie Plus Program). Because these programs have been developed only for 3 years, so you can not objectively assert how they affect the demographic structure of society, or motivate you to make decisions about having a larger number of children. In order to be able to answer this type of questions objectively, ie with regard to relevant scientific data, these Programs should be conducted with a minimum of 2-3 subsequent generations of citizens.On the other hand, there has already been a noticeable increase in consumption for various types of goods purchased by citizens, which has a pro-development effect on the economy as it increases the level of economic growth. It may be one of the key elements of the socio-economic policy of anti-crisis, countercyclical importance, ie increasing the resilience of the domestic economy to global economic crises and the slowdown in global economy growth, e.g. the currently observed slowdown in global economy caused by the so-called war wars and other restrictions on the development of international trade.In the context of the above issues, I am asking you the following question:How can changes in the demographic structure of society affect the economic development of the country?Please replyI invite you to the discussionThank you very muchBest wishes","question_tags":["Family Planning Policy","Economy","Social Science","Public Policy","Public Policy Analysis","Comparative Public Policy","Public Policy Regulation","Economics"]},[{"answer_post_date":"28th Jul, 2019","answer_content":"If there is a youth bulge as in case of many developing countries, economic development would be stifled if youth centric policies are not promoted.

Yes, since the development of civilization, economic systems of countries in antiquity, economic growth is correlated with demographic growth. However, this is not always the same correlation and in various periods the strength and translation of this correlation has changed. Sometimes, in short periods and situations of economic crisis, a shortage of basic consumer products, this correlation was disturbed.\nUsually this is a positive correlation with a changing range of direct proportionality. What is the scope of proportionality and how it changes over time depends on many other objective social, cultural, economic factors etc. as well as on random factors such as natural, cosmic cataclysms, epidemics, wars, etc. In addition, changes are important demographic structure of society.\nIn the currently functioning economies of highly developed countries, the process of economically negative changes in the demographic structure of societies known as the aging of the population has been observed for many years. This process is also correlated with the potential of the workforce, measured by the number of people able to work, at the productive age, with a certain level of education, able to retrain or specify a given productivity.\nThe process of changing the demographic structure, defined as the aging of the population, is usually inversely correlated with the economic growth. It results from the specificity of the dominating factors of the sources of the aging process of society. These factors usually include a decrease in births, a reduction in the fertility rate in families, an increase in incomes and a better standard of living for citizens, including healthier nutrition, improvement of health care system services, etc. Sometimes this process is also determined by the departure of young educated people from the country the limit of the purpose of employment in positions with higher remuneration.\nFor modern economies in which social support systems and participatory pension systems operate, linked directly or indirectly to the public finance system of the state, aging of the population is a source of rapid growth of state budget expenditure and in most countries of the world is one of the key factors in the emergence and increase of the budget deficit in the state budget, also increase public debt.\nIf there is no possibility of balancing the state budget from additional income, if these additional incomes are not then social assistance systems and public pension systems are reformed. The purpose of the reform is usually to reduce spending on state finances, and thus to decrease the purchasing value of pensions and benefits, and to partially or partially privatize the pension system by creating commercially active and managed open pension funds investing citizens' retirement contributions, future retirees in various financial instruments of commercially operating financial markets, i.e. primarily the money and capital markets.\nSuch processes have been taking place since the end of the 1990s in the country where I operate. such reforms were carried out. In order to slow down the economically unfavorable process of aging, pro-social programs have been introduced that are key pillars of the current socio-economic policy, ie the Rodzina 500 Plus Program and the Flat Plus Program (Mieszkanie Plus).

As such, economic growth apparently is affected by a number of factors such as the labor productivity and its growth, the labor force participation rate, the number of work hours in a society, savings rate, investments, government policies etc. I guess the ultimate question is: How do we unleash the forces of the markets in order to affect both (P) and (L) components of economic growth?

Mainstream economics has forgotten, what is or should be the main aim of an economy: the - not only - material welfare of people. They do not recognize that growth  has limits and that it may damage environment and climate. The formula %GDP=%P+%L (with P average productivity and L total working hours) is tautologically correct, but useless or maybe even misleading. They can lead politicians to introduce measures to increase population growth or to increase working time (or as an argument against reducing it). I am not against growth, for many countries it may be necessary to reach a satisfactory standard of living, but one should not overlook the role of distribution. If possible, growth should be more of qualitative than quantitative character. A thinking experiment how different (even convenional) growth can be: Case 1: population and workforce growth of 1%, increase of the unemployment rate 2%, but employed work 2% more hoursCase 2: constant population but decrease of workforce of 1%, decrease of unemployment rate 2% and 1% less working hoursWith the same productivity growth, total  growth would be about 1% higher in Case 1. Nevertheless, I would prefer Case 2.Ageing is, for most economists, seen as negative as old people (pensioners) are not productive. In fact, it is a positive sign for a society, especially when people grow older in good health (If one looks at old photos, one can often see persons of about 40 years old looking like those nowadays between 50 and 60). Their consumption makes an important share of effective demand and is a strong economic impulse. A high share of old-age-pensioners is, nevertheless, problematic, because it leads to high contributions of the active population (if we do not want to reduce pensions and thus weaken demand). Therefore, a stepwise increase of the pension age is a good measure (although not very popular), but - what is mostly foregotten - should be accompanied by measures to reduce annual working time to compensate its labour supply effect (at least as long unemployment is too high).","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"2"},{"answer_post_date":"5th Aug, 2019","answer_content":" If the population decreases, consumption and production decrease.

Another reason for the shrinkage was emigration (almost 30.000). Austria had a population increase of more than 50.000, which was mainly due to immigration (65.000). About 8.000 died with Corona, the number of births was about 1.500 lower than 2019. I think, that in both countries the average age has slightly gone down - more in Austria than in Poland, because migrants are usually younger than average.But I do not consider this way of \"younging\" as positive and I hope that life expectancy - especially healthy life expectancy - will go up again in the future. And it is not sensible to compensate this aging by \"social policy programs\" aimed at higher birth rates. These programs usually go at the cost of women and are damaging the society.The (Neoclassical) economists' fear of a lack of workforce has no real base as long as so many people are unemployed.

I am sure that there are several thousends Polish cititzens unemployed in Austria, whereas Austrian unemployed in Poland can be counted by hand. In most European countries, unemployment has already been too high even before the Covid crisis. For the long run, you are very pessimistic inasfar as you foresee a lack of workforce, if there are not enough births nowadays. I think that, in the long run, can easily adjust to such a development.

In a country where there is currently a relatively low unemployment rate, it results from a large amount of additional public money pumped into the economy in the form of wage subsidies in companies. However, the level of public debt of the state finance system is already approaching the safe level of 60% according to EU standards. GDP and therefore the government will soon end or significantly reduce the scale of anti-crisis financial public aid, which will be associated with a short-term or medium-term increase in unemployment in 2021.

This may be true for Poland and some other Eastern new EU members, but today I heard a message that the (EU or EURO countries) average level (end 2020) is above 100%. The EU has suspended the 60%-rule, and I think and hope that this limit will not be reintroduced during the next 10 years. This number seems to be the result of a calculation based on the Domar model: Assuming a long-term 5% nominal GDP growth (optimistic view end of the 1980ies) and a budget deficit of 3% (Maastricht-limit), Domar shows that the debt ratio would approach 60% (deficit/growth). In a correct calculation (using the annual stocks and flows instead of calculus, i.e. integrals) the result would be 63%.All these figures are quite arbitrary. Nobody can say what is a \"safe level\" of public debt. The Japanese debt/GDP  ratio e.g. has been above 100% for about (more than?) 30 years already, but it seems that Japan's economy is safer than those of many countries with a much lower public debt.About 15 years ago, we had a discussion in a OECD Working Party about reaching the 60% goal. I said I could imagine that our followers might discuss how to reduce public debt to below 80% or 100% of GDP. Most colleagues opposed to that, the Japanese colleague supported me.

As early as September 2008, this interpretation began to change. In many countries, more secure strategies for the implementation of fiscal policy, budget policy, etc. have been adopted in order to avoid excessively high levels of the risk of destabilization of the state finance system. Just before the global financial crisis of 2008, i.e. in the period of several years preceding the then largest global financial crisis in the economic history of the world, the first symptoms of the approaching cataclysm in the banking sectors of the Anglo-Saxon model were already visible, however, they were ignored because most economies recorded spectacular high levels. economic growth and capital markets, stock markets were euphoric for rapidly rising valuations of securities, property prices rose, unemployment was low, interest rates were low, credit was readily available, etc. Few people cared about taking the rising levels of public debt seriously . And when the 2008 global financial crisis appeared, these levels of public debt in many countries increased further and another problem emerged, ie the debt crisis of the state finance system. this problem concerned a significant part of smaller economies, economies of developing countries, incl. the economies of southern Europe. So, in the context of the current economic crisis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) coronavirus pandemic, the current question is: Have any conclusions been drawn from the previous experience of financial and economic crises and are there currently both commercially operating financial systems (including banking) and are the state's public finance systems safer, more secured than those 15 years ago?  The example of Japan is a classic example of a significant advantage of foreign investment over the above-mentioned exceeding 100%. public debt in relation to GDP. Therefore, in the case of Japan, the risk of destabilization of the state finance system in the event of the emergence of successive international economic and financial crises is much lower than in the case of countries with this indicator, which defines the relative level of public debt, much lower. In my opinion, the governments of many countries interpret this indicator differently when its level is elevated in the country and at a much higher level than the international average of this indicator, and differently when the same level of the indicator is around this average. Moreover, governments of many countries approach the level of this indicator differently at different times, e.g. during an election year. In a country where I operate at the beginning of the pro-market and pro-democratic system transformation, which began in 1989, at the beginning of the 1990s, a provision was entered into the Constitution to maintain a safe level of indebtedness in the state finance system. Such a provision is used in the legal norms of basic laws in some countries. This is to prevent over-indebtedness as part of the government-led social and economic policy. This is to prevent the government from leading to a situation of excessively high risk of destabilization of the state's financial system not only in the current but also in the long term, i.e. taking into account possible further large national or international financial and / or economic crises, which could lead to the declaration of insolvency by state. On the other hand, another problem that appeared relatively recently is the issue of creative accounting aimed at showing a lower level of indebtedness of the state finance system than the actual state, taking into account all interest, costs, etc., which will affect the level of this debt also in subsequent years. Another important issue in the context of this issue is the direct purchase of domestic treasury bonds by the national central bank and the introduction of additional billions of currencies into the economy through specially created public institutions. If the majority of billions of additional money is introduced into the economy as part of anti-crisis interventionist economic policy programs in this way, it is not included in the commonly used indebtedness ratios of the state finance system, despite the fact that macroeconomic effects already appear, e.g. through rising inflation. In view of the above, I agree with you that the use of this indebtedness ratio of the state finance system should take into account the incomplete international comparability of its application. It should be borne in mind that this indicator does not always fully reflect the actual situation. In addition, the interpretation of specific indications of the level of debt of the state finance system resulting from this ratio of public debt to GDP is often relative, because it changes over time and focuses not on a specific number 50%, 60%, 100%. etc. only on relative international comparability in relation to the average level of this indicator.

Especially Neoclassical ones think in terms of a (Solow) production function, that GDP growth depends on capital growth, the deveopment of labour force and technical progress. With a low birth rate, they see the danger that labour force is shrinking, which - under the assumption of full-employment - would lead to a lower growth and at the same time increasing the burden of the active population to finance the pensions for the increasing number of pensioners.I think, it is good, if policy manages to increase healthy life expectation. This means, of course, an aging of the society, unless there is no adequate population growth - be it via a higher birth rate or via immigration. (It is interesting, that countries, which try to promote births, are often strictly against immigration). But I also think, that trying to grow out of aging is not a feasible policy. The world population is high enough, one could even say, the world is overpopulated. And also in most European countries, the population density is high enough. Therefore, I see no problem, if populations would slightly shrink. Without increasing retirement age, this would mean a reduction of the active part of the population. I see that as an advantage, because this could ease the reduction of the unemployment and promote technical progress (as labour-saving investment would become more important). With higher wages and pension reforms people would stay longer in the workforce, thereby reducing the pension expenditures. GDP growth may be moderate (with reductions of the working time, GDP may even slightly shrink, which would be good for the environment), but welfare (per head) would develope better than with policies to increase population (especially if this policy is to the disadvantage of women).","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"27th Mar, 2021","answer_content":"Dear Anton Rainer,Yes, I fully understand your point of view.

I agree with you that the concept of \"human capital\" is not the most perfect, but it has been adopted in many scientific and business environments (as an important, often the most important production factor in the context of production processes, economic growth, etc.). I understand that the economy should develop in such a way as to serve the society, improve the standard of living even in the situation of economically unfavorable changes in the demographic structure of society, defined as the aging of the society. Yes, but it would be possible in the long run, in the context of min. for the next several decades, if the level of technological progress would take place faster than other unfavorable social, economic, political and other processes, i.e. e.g. if the loss of the labor force necessary for the effective functioning of the economy (at a certain level, even without growth) would be missing hands to work would be replaced by an increase in the automation of production processes, autonomous robots serving people in various services, playing the role of home helpers, replacing people in many professions and professions. However, it is not certain whether equipping the economy with other production factors (apart from the diminishing human capital) will be sufficient in the situation of various global, international and regional economic, financial, natural, pandemic and climate crises forecasted more and more often. In my opinion no. For example, over the next several decades of the intensifying climate crisis, the scale of the cross-border flow of people will increase, coming from poorer countries to economically richer ones, countries with a higher standard of living and more favorable climatic conditions for living, agricultural development, etc. The above-mentioned processes of cross-border migration population, they will also counteract the aging of society in highly developed countries. If the process of climate change, including the ongoing global warming process, is inevitable and, unfortunately, irreversible, then also the above-mentioned other, derivative processes are also inevitable.

The \"effects\" of the real Covid-19 virus were demonstrated on TV from WuHan China, as if this virus was a lethal phenomenon designed to scare people into thinking that they too could drop dead in the streets within 10 minutes of contracting this phenomenon. The subjects in the video were clearly suddenly affected by something and they did collapse and die quite quickly.The truth about this was actually the first deployment of newly mounted 5G antennae in WuHan China broadcasting frequencies of 60GHz, which attack the CNS and disable the thoracic muscles preventing breathing. The natural reaction to this electromagnetic assault is for the body to release mucus into the lungs to force the muscles to \"cough\" out the blockage, which never occurs because the nerves are unable to send instructions to the muscles (and there is no blockage anyway) and the subject consequently quickly drowns in their own mucus.Many governments already had the Covid pandemic paraphernalia prepoared in warehouses and ready for deployment, with all the relevant printed notices, Covid gadgets, sterilising products, specific Covid rules, and pandemic obedience and distancing restrictions, processes and procedures, along with Covid testing pharmaceuticals etc - all available and ready for immediate use almost seamlessly and mysteriously, just as the pandemic was publicly announced. This didn't seem strange to anyone at the time, but it clearly was, and still is.The unspoken aim appears to have been to oblige people to voluntarily seek the apparently hastily prepared \"vaccine\", so that they could become immune from the devastating viral infection seen on TV, whereas, in reality, the injection was clearly the sneaky reason for the pandemic and the sudden announced availability of the FREE vaccine for everyone. Very few people questioned this sudden good fortune and they mindlessly sought the vaccination without any further thought and without a second's delay.Clearly it couldn't possibly have been a genuine vaccine, because the development of serious vaccines always takes up to 20 years of testing before it can be declared safe for humans, so, the injections were quite obviously something else. Indeed, the alleged vaccinations contained another virus, other materials and lots of graphene oxide, which turns into graphene hydroxide when it comes into contact with a liquid such as blood or mucus. (Also used on Covid testing swabs).The virus in \"the vaccine\"  has been shown by various internationally renowned virologists, to interact with human DNA, and to update it in strange ways, none of which has anything to do with vaccination, Covid-19, Coronavirus Novello 2019 nor any other cold or flu.Without going into too much detail, this epidemiological catastrophe was perpetrated by world governments led by their agreements pledged with the WHO, and for a variety of pressing economic reasons - meaning, that we can now no longer categorically rely on governments to devise legitimate public health policies for our future epidemiological health requirements, which ought to be in the interests of ordinary people. World political leaders are now in control of that and not research scientists.This is why I have created the aforementioned national government paradigm (above) which includes an element of national state authority called the Institute of Citizenship Research (ICR) of which there may have to be a specific committee focussing entirely upon the epidemiological issues which greatly concern the health of a nation, and in particular, the viral updates to human DNA which have been revealed recently to directly affect the human content of the individuals of a nation in terms of ideology, culture, intellect and motivation. (See the latest research on viral updates deployed in vaccine content for more details). This new worrying development in the evolution of epidemiology should, in theory, concern us all greatly.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"count":15}]],[{"question_post_date":"28th Jun, 2021","question_title":"How can I be a student peer reviewer in the field of life science (more specifically in Cancer Immunology)?","question_image_url":null,"question_content":"I am currently finalizing my Master of Science in Biochemistry.

Expert  - the article also recommends, especially for initial course design,  have an expert or seasoned professional part of your design process if possible.Online Teaching in Particular  However, we have experienced a number of structural changes that I  think are going to fundamentally shift the landscape in online teaching.  Many of these changes are going by unnoticed or unexamined on their  ultimate impact in terms of the online landscape. Indeed, until they  have time to play out in terms of their ultimate influence, we are again  facing unknowns as to what kind of landscape we are navigating and how  these and other exogenous variables have an impact. Let me give two brief examples, regarding teachers and teaching strategies of newly online teachers. TeachersThe  number of teachers that now have online teaching experience has also  expanded exponentially. Pre-COVID teachers that taught online were  trained, nurtured, and supported in best practices. The new cadre of  online teachers have not had that luxury and almost all institutions now  have an online teaching expectation with many of the previous support  structures strained or nonexistent. Unfortunately, this new cadre may be  subject to retrospective sense-making, confusing past online  experiences with best practices. Put another way teachers that are  overwhelmed in terms of class development, little support, and marginal  training may defer to stopgap measure that they used for online courses  as adequate for quality instruction. Since they have no comparative  experience and their students do not either it may perpetuate a number  of practices that give the and illusion of adequacy but may diminish the  quality of online education. On the flip side, since the sheer number  of teachers engaged in the online environment has expanded beyond what  anyone could imagine, there may be a variety of new or unexamined best  practices that never emerged under  old online research and pedagogy. Teaching Strategies for Newly Online Teachers  Deletion will Rule  I am afraid that most will defer to the path of least resistance so it  depends on the length of the deferral and the modality of the content.  It would seem that deletion will rule since it is far easier to delete  less prominent content and draw additional lines of student learning  objectives to major projects etc.  In terms of modality, many schools  cannot count on one modality unless they prep for entirely online  courses.  The latter imperils their identity so my suspicion is that  there are a number that will struggle to produce face to face or  synchronous surrogates (online real-time).   Regardless of face to face  modality (100%, hybrid, or flex) ultimately this means more demands in  terms of time, coordination, stress, and capabilities.  The best  treatment for this issue will depend on the four previous elements.   Often the courses are designed with an eye to the wrong metrics for  students (although it may be a necessary evil for accreditation).Transfer is key. What  does it matter if I include material that has students touching the  topics but in a way that provides little central route processing or  long term integration?  I must admit that one of the positive outcomes  of COVID is that it has made me question the integrity of my material.  I  have had to revise a great many vestigial assignments that certainly  meet the typical academic fare but contribute little to students'  ultimate course of study in terms of portability and longevity of use.  The best practice for this issue is that students need to be insured of  the integrity of the value of the material, the core material needs to  be proactively identified, multi-modality plans need to be executed, and  these plans need to be created with the maximum transfer as the  ultimate goal. Modification Through Curation of Content This means that a one size fits all plan may be ill-suited unless it  supersedes instructors natural tendencies or capabilities ( a very real  possibility).  To that end, the plan that may be the best is the one  that will keep the student engaged, be within the capabilities of the  instructor, and connect within the broader framework of the curriculum.   So my preference is modification within the limitations described  above.  However, reality suggests that may not be possible, especially  with modality and semester-length shifting.  So picking the best  obtainable scenario through careful content curation may ultimately be  the least harmful solution and this again suggests that deletion will  rule most strategic plans. We  might quibble about the status quo and what improvement means but regardless of the definition, I  think we can agree that teaching has been disrupted and we are in desperate need for quick ways to move forward.  Additional ContentThis may be beyond what you are looking for and is a bit of shameless self-promotion but if you are looking for a  variety of perspectives,  The  Journal of Literacy and Technology has  just published a rapid response journal on this very subject (suddenly  online education).  I  will be the  first to admit that some of the findings are not the perfect answer that  everyone is looking for.    However, they do speak to the point that  whether we like it or not,  the educational world (technology-heavy or  light)  has fundamentally been disrupted.  The scholarship within the  journal was created by people in the pandemic, for people in the  pandemic.  If  you want a more expansive look at the issues, it might be helpful as an  expose on first findings in suddenly online research.

We recently published a review paper on this topic that you could find useful (doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148607). From the definition, endogenous respiration means respiration in absence of external substrate; normally this is accomplished by aerating the activated sludge (withdrawn from the tested WWTP) for about 24 h (to remove residual substrate) and then, proven that saturation conditions are reached, stopping the aeration. The specific oxygen reduction through time, calculated as mg O2/L min (or equivalent) represent the endogenous respiration (it is called endogenous oxygen uptake rate, OUR). Of course, to do that you need an oxygen meter with adeguate resolution and precision.Regarding the exogenous respiration, normally sodium acetate is used as representative of readily biodegradable organic matter. One of the possible protocols (deoxygenation test) consists in adding different amounts of acetate to the activated sludge and evaluating oxygen consumption through time. Similarly to the endogenous respiration, also in this case you need to start from saturation conditions, stop aeration and then dose the acetate. You will observe an abrupt increase in oxygen consumption after dosing acetate; when the acetate is consumed, endogenous conditions are restored. Consequently, it is possible to calculate the oxygen consumed for exogenous respiration. Finally, you can build a calibration line by plotting the oxygen consumption (mg O2/L) versus the added readily biodegradable COD (as acetate) (mg COD/L).","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"30th Sep, 2021","answer_content":"Dear Matia Mainardis thanks for your time and response.

To give two examples:1. If email clients are designed to support emails that contain attachments and links to websites then the software should ensure that they can be opened securely, inside a protected \"sandbox\" or similar safe environment. It is absurd to call it \"uer error\" when someone is tricked into opening malware in an email, because the user is using their software exactly as it has been designed to be used. The designer of the email client is to blame, not the user.2. Buffer overflows and injection attaccks are possible because the software has not been written and verified to be cybersecure. It is perfectly possible to write software so that run-time failures cannot occur, for example by using the static analysis tools and correct-by-construction methods in the SPARK toolset that Praxis/Altran/Adacore promote.  Current software development is amateurish, relying on testing to provide evidence that the software is fit for purpose, despite 50 years of experience and theory that shows that testing can never show the absence of defects and that software should be developed with mathematical rigour. No other engineers rely on testing without a foundation of mathematical reasoning and proof.I would like to see the UN co-ordinate and support a long-term programme of work to vastly improve the tools and methods used by programmers worldwide, because cybersecurity will continue to get worse until the problem of defective software is tackled with science-based engineering tools and methods, and a recognition that the developers of faulty software must carry liability for the damage they cause.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"2"},{"answer_post_date":"23rd Feb, 2021","answer_content":"Many thanks, dear Arian Besnik Kadriu, for your very accurate and important remark.

Scientists need their work to be promoted but we often ignore how to achieve that goal in an efficient way. We ignore when and where to do it, who should do it, and what alternatives we have if we are not satisfied with their job. So....

Research should be question-driven and well-informed about other research in the field.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"11th Nov, 2020","answer_content":"I teach research design. Most of the designs relate to interdisciplinary social sciences with a few earth/hard sciences in the mix. I frequently instruct international groups of upper level undergrads, graduate students and professionals. I often teach this during field schools. Student teams have to dream up a few relevant research questions, formulate hypotheses, come up with a reasonable methodology given constraints and eventually present results in a professional forum within approximately 6 weeks. It's been very successful thus far. Simplicity (not to be confused with simple), clarity and critical thinking are key. 1) Develop a relevant and doable research question; 2) reformulate research question into a hypothesis if necessary (basically, answer the question with knowledge available), 3) develop a flexible methodology (often confused with methods; i.e., methodology is picking the most appropriate methods under given constraints to address the research problem, question, hypothesis... like picking the right tools from a toolbox to fix a flat tire versus paint a house and within the time, money, resource, access, ethical, legal, etc. constraints); this includes background research and analytical and interpretive methods/techniques/approaches in addition to data collection and/or experimentation...; 4) interpretation, discussion, future directions, recommendations, etc. 5) information dissemination and reporting. These can be expanded or collapsed as needed. Each committee, department, institution, agency, etc. usually expects a certain structure or template that is not always as consistent across the board as we would like. Anyway, there's no way to cover everything and consider everything, even with the simplest and most expedient research questions and agendas. Ensuring nothing is missed and all things are covered is impossible. However, it's important to minimize relevant gaps and maximize relevant thoroughness as much as possible. Generally, peer feedback is vitally useful to accomplish this. Also, all aspects can be infinite. Again, it's impossible to account for everything, especially in Social Sciences where percentages and ratios take precedence over absolutes; parameters, variables and such can be recreated, divided, amalgamated in any number of manners; and unexpected outcomes are common, not to mention 'outliers' are always expected. For applied research, there's a need to focus on relevant aspects to address the phenomena, needs, questions and problems at hand. Hope this helps a bit. Let me know.

My general approach is a theory of action framework that considers actors responding to situations (=perceived and evaluated conditions of actions) according to their interests by formulating goals and utilising resources to achieve these goals. From this follows that interests and properties of actors are always intervening variables. On the conditions side, I have a heuristic that distinguishes kinds of conditions of actions - epistemic/technological, economic, social (in a narrower sense), institutional, and cultural. This gives me a frame for my search that I believe to be exhaustive, i.e. it makes sure that I don't overlook conditions. For empirical investigations, cases are selected in order to systematically vary some of these conditions (described by independent variables), while others are kept constant. Concerning effects, I am only interested in specific effects, which means that I am selective but also open for unexpected effects, feedback loops etc. As a qualitative researcher who is intersted in causal mechanisms, I then thinka bout actions /sequences of actions that mediate between conditions and effects because they are likely to occur under the conditions of interest and are likely to produce the effects I am interested in. These sequences of actions are likely to 'contain' the mechanisms I am looking for.

In other words, non-scientific views were engrained in human minds at least during 99% of humanity's history. Expectations that average human viewpoints could be significantly changed during just 0.9% of humankind's history are unrealistic.At the same time, the importance of spreading out scientific views is growing. I will note out just one point why it is so right now.In my book \"Subsurface History of Humanity: Direction of History,\" I identified seven (!!!) global known unknowns. In a short time timeframe, they could derail humankind from its current trajectory. For the first time in its history, humanity is close to the inflection point in its development. By the way, nuclear weapons, which could wipe out all humanity, are just one part of one of those known unknowns.Scientists are more knowledgeable and globally organized than a population in general.

The 4IR curriculum needs to respond to the political and social tensions that will accompany the accelerating pace of technological change, and to respond to the paradox of technologies that simultaneously increase democratization and centralize wealth and political influence. As described in one of the WEF reports, the political effects of the expansion and convergence of the physical, digital and biological worlds will be profound. This development will “enable citizens to engage with governments, voice their opinions, coordinate their efforts, and even circumvent the supervision of public authorities. Simultaneously, governments will gain new technological powers to increase their control over populations.2. With the evolution of online instruction and expanding uses of AI, new guidelines are needed to provide a theoretical basis for digital pedagogy. Some have called the old models of teaching “anthropocentric humanism” and the new types of digital education “critical posthumanism.” These approaches stress that digital education is more than a purely technical concern, as online environments change the dynamics of space and time to create new learning cultures that challenge our earlier notions of social interactions and enable new perspectives on our shared humanity, independent of geographic boundaries.Such a curriculum can also help students grapple with the complex issues of relationships within online spaces and the philosophical dimensions of AIs that may approach or even surpass human intelligence. One author has created a “Cyborg Manifesto” to help explain the social reality for a cybernetic organism, which would be a “creature in a post-gender world” where divisions between nature and culture, public and private and human and non-human break down.3. A new 4IR curriculum will need to reduce the divisions between humanities and STEM to create a more integrated system of education which can explore the newly emerging conceptions of self and identity within the 4IR, including discussions of autonomy, free will, and genetic vs. social determinism. The changing nature of social relations and interactions—social media, obligations to identity groups, society, nation and world needs to be central in the 4IR curriculum as all of these identities and loyalties are shifting rapidly due to increased globalization.4. More than ever, higher education in the 4IR age must develop the capacity not just for analyzing and breaking a technical or scientific problem into its constituent parts, but also must emphasize the interconnections between each scientific problem across global scales and interrelations between physical, chemical, biological and economic dimensions of a problem. As one author has put it, “there is a single planetary technical system” in which globally scaled markets enable “hundreds of thousands of transactions and information exchanges take place at the speed of light within the space of a microsecond.”","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"11th Oct, 2021","answer_content":"Education needs to address 1) globalization and 2) specialization.

Routines enable researchers to make out some of the dynamics which govern the organization, by fostering stability or, on the contrary, favoring development and change. Organizational routines are `repetitive, recognizable patterns of interdependent actions, carried out by multiple actors. The ground-laying works forging the interest in routines have paved a new way towards the understanding of the organization. One gains better insight into the relevant organizational dynamics within the organizations so as to learn to identify them, recognize them and influence them in order to eventually endeavor to better manage them.

Many people assume that foodborne illness is mostly caused by eating at restaurants, but there are many ways in which cross-contamination can occur. There are three main types of cross-contamination: food-to-food, equipment-to-food, and people-to-food.Food-to-food\nAdding contaminated foods to non-contaminated foods results in food-to-food cross-contamination. This allows harmful bacteria to spread and populate (6Trusted Source). Raw, undercooked, or improperly washed food can harbor large amounts of bacteria, such as Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, and Listeria monocytogenes — all of which can harm your health if consumed. Foods that pose the highest risk of bacterial contamination include leafy greens, bean sprouts, leftover rice, unpasteurized milk, soft cheeses, and deli meats, as well as raw eggs, poultry, meat, and seafood.Equipment-to-food\nEquipment-to-food is one of the most common yet unrecognized types of cross-contamination. Bacteria can survive for long periods on surfaces like countertops, utensils, cutting boards, storage containers, and food manufacturing equipment. When equipment is not washed properly or unknowingly contaminated with bacteria, it can transfer large volumes of harmful bacteria to food. This can happen at any point during food production — both at home and in food manufacturing.People-to-food\nHumans can easily transfer bacteria from their bodies or clothes to food during many steps of food preparation.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"2"},{"answer_post_date":"24th Jun, 2021","answer_content":"For transporting pure isolates/culture, you can keep colony into NA by inoculating colony into the media by stabbing the needle into the center of the agar in the eppendrop tube and sealed by sterile liquid paraffin/steile glycerin.

It is hard to design to a vswr of 1.1 unless you design a stepped absorber and are very sure of its complex dielectric and magnetic constants, but making a taper longer will usually improve the vswr.  The sharpness of the point is important.  If it needs to cope with high power the sharpness of the point can be a problem because it may melt if the absorber has high absorption.You could glue it to the side walls but it may need to be longer, depending whether the loss is magnetic or resistive.You can also use a vane of nichrome on kapton film between slits on the centre-lines of the wide faces of the waveguide.

The crop flowering properties; b. The size and the form of the crop plots; c. The competing nectar and pollen sources presenting around and within the crop field.For many orchard crops, like apples and almonds, two strong and healthy honeybee colonies per acre are usually recommended. However, for large uniform plantations even one colony may be adequate, since that crop flowers are the main, or the only honeybee food source. Apple and almond bloom is attractive for honeybees, but avocado bloom, for instance, is much less so. Therefore, if a competing blooming plants are presenting in the vicinity, avocado orchard may demand 3-4 honeybee colonies per acre.

Large trucks move in a place dozens of hives while the trees are flowering. Most of them use the Carniolan or Russian variety of honeybee.

Then shutter and refinish with an epoxy mortar which provides added strength for concrete restoration. This may require a primer to bond to the existing concrete. The epoxy mortar is super strong.

Therefore, PPI percentage changes have a growing effect on exports. If the PPI in the year following the base year (where PPI=100) is, say, 6%, this will have an export effect 4,5% (6*0,745). If the 6% PPI increase takes place in a year after the PPI has reached 200, this would mean a 12-points-PPI-increase and double the effect on export growth than in the former year.I would have troubles to explain such a development and, therefore, propose to include lnPPI (instead of PPI) in your equation. If you get again a  coefficient around 0,75, this could be read as a nominal export elasticity via-a-vis PPI. On the assumption that PPI movements are directly shifted over to exports, this would mean, that a price increase of 1% reduces real exports (demand) by 0,25%. But you can, of course, test the relation between PPI and export prices and include the logs of these in your equation.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"9th May, 2016","answer_content":"Dear RainerI am agreed with you but the problem of taking PPI in log form is that it violates the assumption of multicollinearity because the correlation between production capacity (measured by Trend GDP) and lnPPI is more than 99% . thats why i take the ppi in level to  avoid the problem of multicollinearity so what is your suggestion now can i take the ppi in log in this situation or completely drop from the model as PPI is included in the model to measure the factor costs in export supply function. ithanks and best regardsIrshad","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"10th May, 2016","answer_content":"Dear Irshad,Firstly, I want to remind you to my first answer on your topic, that, in general, it is impossible to estimate an export supply function, because what can be observed are exports which result from supply AND demand and possibly other (political) factors. One can estimate an export supply function only if one has good reasons for the assumption that exports are only driven by supply or if one chooses data only from periods where this was likely the case.I think that one should never choose a (non-)transformation, i.e. leave a correct specification because of purely statistical problems (like multicollinearity). But you have the possibility to transform the whole equation ino a difference one, like    dlnX = ....a*dlnCapacity + dlnPPI + ..., which does not principally change the specification and is likely to considerably reducing multicollinearity. If not, one of the variables must be \"thrown-out\" and there is only the choice to estimate a combined effect (coefficient).Instead of dln, I prefer percentage changes, because I know nobody who thinks in logs.As you see PPI as a proxy for factor costs, its effect on export supply should be negative, because an increase of cost means less profitablity. But if supply is the limiting factor, exporters should not have problems to shift over cost increases to export prices. Under these circumstances, one can expect that demand would not strongly react to these price increases (i.e. price elasticity near 0), leaving real exports almost unchanged and inreasing nominal exports by a similar percentage as the PPI increase. But that leads to the question, why exporters have not set higher (more profitable) prices already before, and this leads back to the role of export demand.Best regards,Anton","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"","answer_content":"percentage change in Y equals  100 times coefficient times change in X.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"30th Mar, 2022","answer_content":"The coefficients in a linear-log model represent the estimated unit change in your dependent variable for a percentage change in your independent variable.

However, the actual question is \"How to prove that a set of words [is] more meaningful than other set[s] of words?\" My question is then: Meaningful to whom? You see, as a poet, I write from what I playfully call \"The Griffin Imperative.\" When I first began writing, my mentor, Shaun Griffin, laid out the workshop's first rule: Write only what you know. And so, for the past thirty years, my poetry is measured by what I know; and what I know I want to say is tested against what words mean. Of course, in poetry, like in probably all literature, there is the language process of diction, the selection of vocabulary that one believes will add clarity. So, to suggest an answer to your question, I say that once you have a line, a sentence, written, then write it again with perhaps a different attitude. Then write it again until you are satisfied with the set of words that best elicits the meaning you intend. In short, there is no universal formula to prove what set of words is more meaningful. What in the long run will make you a better writer is the ability to process meaning through personal experience - to elicit from the reader the closest meaning to your original meaning.

'Knowledge is the accumulation of facts and information. Wisdom is the synthesis of knowledge and experiences into insights that deepen one’s understanding of relationships and the meaning of life. In other words, knowledge is a tool, and wisdom is the craft in which the tool is used.'I see wisdom as the ability to use the knowledge that you have, and as the above quotation indicates, it is the ability to learn through your experiences of life to use your knowledge. So, I see it as something that develops and grows as you get older. Years ago, people used the term 'gumption' more.  I looked up the meaning, and it described it as 'shrewd or spirited initiative and resourcefulness', where 'shrewd' was 'powers of judgement'. People using their wisdom and 'powers of judgement'I don't think it is the cleverest of people who are the wisest, but those who can use the knowledge that they have to make the best decisions.This could become an interesting discussion.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"1st Sep, 2020","answer_content":"Md. Abul Kalam Azad Knowledge is a piece of truth. So anything that is true, can be treated as knowledge. For example, we can say 'fire is hot'. Now this is true. So it is a piece of knowledge. If we know this, we can be called knowledgeable about it. Now let us keep this piece of truth somewhere and then look at it from different angles. We will get different views. For example, we can say that since fire is hot, it can burn. We can also say that its spreading can be prevented by spraying water. There can be innumerable such corollaries derived from a piece of knowledge. Such corollaries are called wisdom. Therefore, it can be concluded that knowledge is still, it is constant irrespective of time, place and the person concerned. It is independent. But wisdom varies. It is never constant. It is dependent on time, place and the person concerned.It can also be concluded that knowledge cannot be improved, but wisdom can be.Most of the time basic research gives us knowledge and applied research gives us wisdom.

This term has been often related to (scientifically speaking) insight learning and creativity. Now, lot of information that we process happens to be at subliminal level. Usually at this level we register some information but usually do not pay attention to it, thereby keeping it from our short-term memory and it is subsequently not available for higher levels processing that involve manipulating the information to solve problems or achieve understanding. However, sometimes at subliminal level, some processing may happen, some connections may be formed (between chunks of information). We may not have attended to that consciously so we may not remember, but when situational cue or demand is there- it's there, the answer or understanding- and we call it intuition. Further people who have intuition have so about things they are familiar with. Human memory is far from perfect, we keep storing information without indexing them properly, so the retrieval is tricky.  If we thus explain intuition as a cognitive process with ill-defined pathway, then anything that enhances attentional bias towards certain kind of information (making sure we identify and register some information of interest from a pool of distractions) thereby facilitating subliminal registration (even processing) may make \"having INTUITION\" easier.For more explore Dr. Gary Klein's research on Recognition Primed Decision (RPD) model.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"2nd Sep, 2013","answer_content":"I believe ,Intuition is a natural gift but to be cultivated & develop by tuning from the within with the help of our mind .It has got nothing to do any particular religion or practice .However whatever the system & practice we may follow & cultivated ,Calm & serene mind is one of the basic essence & with the help of Power of Prayer or even nature practice with the firm faith & regular practice of Meditation will certain help us to shake hand with us initial with a vibratory forces to offer stimulation .Once has to take that under no circumstance negative vibratory instinct in our mind .If above practice is followed Intuition may surely become a nature part of our life.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"3rd Sep, 2013","answer_content":"This a very good question.

Movement parameters are captured by sensors and data is streamed in real-time to the computer. There is a fair amount of variability in the sensors readings: in the attached figure, data points captured from 3 sensors during execution of 10 repetitions of 2 types of movement are shown in the attached file.A couple of important points:1) In regards to training data: many subjects will be performing the same types of movements, in slightly different ways. Given the small number of repetitions that each subject will be contributing for each class (say, around 10), we want to take advantage of across-subject structure.2) In regards to classification: Classification needs to happen in \"real time\", i.e. while data is streamed. We can assume a typical movement duration (say, 5 seconds) to define a \"page size\" of data to use for the classification, but that can be pretty variable, both within and across subjects. Ideally, the classifier will return a class more frequently, e..g once per second; obviously, at the beginning of a new movement there will be large uncertainty about the class, which will be getting smaller as more data is streamed.","question_tags":["Computational Biomechanics","Kinesiology","Human Movement","Human Movement Science","Signal, Image and Video Processing","Human-Computer Interaction","Human Computer Interface","Gesture Recognition"]},[{"answer_post_date":"27th Oct, 2015","answer_content":"Dear Colleague,Thank you for introducing this kind of research and for asking an interesting question. Although we do not have a direct answer for you right now, this situation reminds me of the clustering of spatiotemporal data in gait research.Our (upper- and lower-limb functional anatomy) research group dealt with evaluating gait frequencies (in primates and in other mammals as well). We recently compared such frequencies in man during health, and during the progression and the rehabilitation of neuropathic diseases. Some papers about it are, or will be on our ResearchGate site.So in spite of all differences between upper and lower limb (interesting enough), your classifying problem may be redefined as a clustering problem. I add one seminal literature example in attachment (Kienast et al., 1999) about lower limb data.    Asking (bio-)statisticians may be helpful, in order to redefine your question. They will possibly suggest to you the right formulas and algorithms and / or software for this.Wishing you success in continuing your project,with kind regards,Koos Jaap van Zwieten","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"28th Oct, 2015","answer_content":"Dear  Stavros,in the figures you attached, I see a three dimensions space with acceleration (m/sec^2 ?), Rotation (angle values), and EMG which stands for electromyography, I suppose.To my knowledge EMGs create very noisy data, depending on position, experimenter's ability , and on the condition of skin and muscle. So it can be very difficult to use these data.Apart this, generally speaking, when you use sensors on people, some data may be less reliable than others and they can be more noisy and less usable, of course. This is a common situation. I tried to figure out a solution by proposing a general method to deal with this problem.You could  reduce noise, using a feature selection approach and then count the frequencies of the intraclass features, to improve the validity of data for the  specific movement, exploiting repetitions; then also count  inter-class frequencies of the same features, reducing the importance of the less selective ones, according to a formula (see attachment). This could answer to your vision of across validation.For  more specific details,  you may eventually look at my paper in attachment.The results that I personally  obtained on a public dataset (created by U.C.Berkeley)  were pretty impressive even on very noisy data, reducing of four time the error rate of Berkeley researcher on their own dataset .The paper is quite preliminary so if you need, I am available by e-mail, for further explanations.It could be necessary to pass from value space to a feature space, but maybe it is not stricly required: the method could be adapted on the given space, I think.About real time it depends on how fast it is the required reaction, and why.I applied my method in realtime, on continuous acquisitions of several minutes,  but this requires a segmentation operation.

Not just a \"scientific concept”.But realtime is a fuzzy term, for it is “function” of the request. E.g. for a package shipping from NY to Washington, an hour for the delivery it is \"real-time\", is superfast. For an airbag sensor,  to react in less than 30 milliseconds means realtime. So, which  times of reactions are required?For my realtime tests my rationale was speech recognition:  the method suggested to me by my former advisor Roberto Bisiani that worked for some years on realtime speech recognition matters, when he was a researcher and then professor at Carnegie Mellon University.In speech recognition you divide a temporal acquisition in tiny  (circa 10 millisec) temporal slices and then you extract features  for (e.g.) HMM analysis. I do not use HMM, only my own method.We are dipendent from Nyquist sample theorem: I used slices at regular rate of  ¾ sec (it was just a test, slide should be of different dimensions in my opinion).I think  the methodology can be adapted to the time series for quasi-immediate reactions.We could work together on the question, and eventually collaborate, at your ease, if you want.I am reachable at pinardi@disco.unimib.it for any question.My Best,Stefano","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"7th Nov, 2015","answer_content":"helo dearSports movements consisting of a private sports divisions and each division but their own vision so it can be divided into several divisions as follows: -* Division movements by physiological bases* Division movements by foundations associated with the stages of movement* Divided by mechanical movements foundations","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"count":5}]],[{"question_post_date":"4th Apr, 2019","question_title":"How do you get the necessary information from Big Data database systems?","question_image_url":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dariusz-Prokopowicz/post/How-do-you-get-the-necessary-information-from-Big-Data-database-systems/attachment/5ca5fc9c3843b01b9b978210/AS%3A743946099621888%401554381980034/image/DISCUSSION_D.Prokopowicz_.How+do+you+get...necessary+information+from+Big+Data+database+systems.jpg","question_content":"How to obtain currently necessary information from Big Data database systems for the needs of specific scientific research and necessary to carry out economic, business and other analyzes?Of course, the right data is important for scientific research.

As you say, \"Proverbs are commonly used in communicating important and deep meanings,\"--yes, in Africa and most everywhere else, I believe. But I do not know of detailed studies of the phenomenon. Proverbs are used to express commonly accepted precepts, I would say to start; but they are more than commonly accepted. They are often regarded as points of wisdom, and may be used to summarize or finalize the presentation of a claim or thesis. Insofar as all concerned know the same proverbs, their rhetorical power increases. On the other hand, where they need to be explained, because unfamiliar, this is a sign of some lack of common background belief, attitude or presuppositions.My own experience is that proverbs come to me, in the course of a discussion. On the other hand, it is sometimes quite difficult to simply give examples out of the context of the specific need for them in the course of discussion. Random examples will often seem trivial, but when one suddenly comes to mind --as needed--it will have much greater force --the commonalities being otherwise the same. In consequence, I tend to think of proverbs as having a cognitive function in oral traditions particularly. On the other hand, there is a book of the Bible named, \"Proverbs.\"My favorite Bible verse is the following:Where there is no wisdom, the people perish, but he who keepth the law, happy is he.  (King James version) This is very old testament, of course. I first came across its significance when I found it inscribed on the side of City Hall, Camden, NJ--just across the river from here. Given what I saw of the city that day, a decade or more back, the verse stood out, it was salient, we might say. It seemed obvious that in spite of the inscription in stone, someone or other had forgotten this verse.H.G.

It is instructive to consider in detail since there are multiple categories of proverbs. For example, \"comparative sayings\" compare two things. Often the comparison is made so as to say that one is better than the other. Though the origin of wisdom literature is a source of constant scholarly debate, it seems clear that wisdom literature collects teachings from several spheres of life. There is an intricate relationship between language and culture. This relationship is exhibited in terms of language being a part of culture, and yet being its vehicle. Culture is \"the way of life for an entire society\" which means that aspects of human life such as codes of manners, dressing, religion, ritual norms, behavior, belief systems and language are subsumed under culture. Culture is lived and language, through all its manifestations, projects that living, giving it form and texture. Four key components of culture have been identified in the sociological literature namely values, norms, institutions and artifacts. Proverbs deal with issues that border on the values, norms, institutions and artifacts of a society across the whole gamut of the people's experiences.

So it seems to take a long time to go from primitive forms to things that most people would have any interest in. In fact, a recent study of the rate of growth of complexity at the level of DNA suggests that even Hadean life was very complex compared to what might be considered the least complicated form of life, and suggests that extremely primitive life forms may have originated around 10 billion years ago, long before the formation of our Solar System, and have been spread throughout our galaxy as frozen organic material by comets and interstellar asteroids. If so, primitive life forms would be even more common than the suggestion in the first paragraph, BUT the time frame between the origin of life and of what we consider complex life then becomes more than twice as long as previously tought, in which case life forms now on the Earth may be the currently most complex in our entire galaxy.So... for life in general, take the biggest number you can think of, and it's probably not big enough. But for complex life forms, depending on how complex you want it to be (e.g., capable of interstellar travel), the number could drop very close to zero.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"3rd Oct, 2018","answer_content":"I guarantee that the number is not infinite.

Further, we cannot rule out the possibility of life without hydrocarbon materials also.  Who are we to declare or conclude that a life must be formed with or in combination of hydrocarbon materials alone? Other solar system or universe may hold life in other form of materials. Our understanding on life forms and universe is very limited. If we compare our understanding on every concepts during the past two centuries we can understand that we had a significant progress. Yet, our understanding is limited.   We don’t know the complete life style of thousands of insects or small creatures or even existence of certain creatures in our mother planet itself. That’s the reason we document or report the existence of new species, newer life cycles for existing species every year. We have only one mother planet (a finite) but the life forms are (infinite) due to lack of our understanding. Theoretically, we can say that the number of life forms exist in our planet must be finite. If so, then what is the final number of total species exist in our world. It is not possible to document each and every form of life exist in all forms of ambient and niches. It is like an attempt to provide precise measurement for sand grains present in the bottom of an ocean. Theoretically, we can provide a number but practically it is not verifiable. The primary reasons is it is in a continuous flux state.  We have superior technologies to measure the movement of an atom but we don’t have technologies to calculate and express such huge data derived from sand grains from single ocean. I would like to express this condition as “impossible to measure or calculate” even within limited time and space.  Here, I would like to denote TAE expression “ Unimaginably large\" is not infinite. Yes, it is practically observed in our civilization or in every field. The depth of an Ocean, height of an mountain which remain unknown in previous centuries are become known in the present century. However, the scenario of “impossible to measure or calculate” even within limited time and space disclosed our own limitation. Hence, the context of infinite applied for universe is “impossible to measure or calculate” We cannot say that the universe is infinite because of ignorance and we cannot speculate that the universe is finite.  Hence, at present universe is infinite since we don’t have the evidence for finite universe.  Likewise, total number and size of universe and its life forms cannot be defined.  The acceptance of our ignorance on the concepts (as infinite) will aid us to explore further about the finite features of the infinite. However, consideration of universe as finite will never allow us to progress since we need to define the final number or finite materials or finite dimension at the first step to measure other systems present within it.

The obvious one is that molecules must be able to replicate themselves. The molecules must be able to defend themselves either from other molecules or from the environment. They must be able to gather simpler molecules as building blocks. Finally they must have a source of energy and be able to transfer the energy from a collection point to a use point. We know that these processes can happen in a water environment. I am not so certain that it could happen in another liquid. Can I make a cell with a water membrane in a lipid sea? One can certainly make an inverse emulsion, but is it possible to make the water membrane complex enough to carry out cell functions?The other issue with using something like liquid methane is that reactions would take place more slowly. My guess is that we do not have to worry about aliens swimming in methane seas. Of course there is some possibility that they were bioengineered to live there, though with that scenario almost anything goes.Our best shot is a planet with liquid water. It might work to have a cold planet warmed by gravitational forces. The ice surface protects a liquid core and thermal vents on the sea floor provide the energy for life to exist.

However, the planet needs enough water to have pools of water that are permanent at geologic time scales. Also there must be enough water to form clouds in the atmosphere to give rain and lightning.

Therefore, the possibilities of applying Industry 4.0 technology are growing, including, among others, machine learning technologies, artificial intelligence, Big Data Analytics, etc. in improving the processes of obtaining and analyzing data from distant galaxies, planetary systems, exoplanets and finding life outside the Solar System. Below I have described the key determinants confirming the formulated research thesis. To the above discussion I would like to add the following conclusion formulated as a summary of my earlier considerations on this topic: Possibilities of using the Industry 4.0 technology in cosmology, astronautics, astrophysics etc.The current technological revolution referred to as Industry 4.0 is determined by the development of the following advanced information processing technologies: Big Data database technologies, cloud computing, machine learning, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, Business Intelligence, Virtual and Augmented Reality, and other advanced technologies of Data Mining . Below I have listed a few technological fields and branches of the knowledge-based economy that have been rapidly developing in recent years, in which analytical technologies carried out in Big Data database systems are used. I propose the development of scientific research in the field of analytics carried out in Big Data database systems in the following topics:The use of information systems, ICT and Industry 4.0 information technologies, including Big Data, Business Intelligence in building and improving specific models of information technology management in analytical processes and scientific research. In recent years, the impact of the implementation process of ICT information technologies, new media internet technologies and Big Data advanced data processing technologies has been noticed in research processes conducted in scientific research. In addition, in recent years Big Data, Data Analytics, Data Science, Business Intelligence, etc. analytical technologies are also used in many other fields of industry, services, production technology improvement, in medicine, biotechnology, in forecasting the future development of complex processes in various branches and knowledge-based economy sectors. In my opinion, the possibilities of applying Industry 4.0 technology are also growing, including, among others, machine learning technologies, artificial intelligence, Big Data Analytics, etc. in improving the processes of obtaining and analyzing data from distant galaxies, planetary systems, exoplanets and finding life outside the Solar System.In line with the above, in my opinion, due to the dynamic development of ICT information technology, Industry 4.0 technology, including advanced processing and analysis of large data sets on Big Data Analytics computerized database platforms, the scale of potential Big Data Analytics applications in various fields of scientific research is growing rapidly , also in prognostic applications.

Kepler-452b (a planet sometimes quoted to be an Earth 2.0 or Earth's Cousin based on its characteristics; also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-7016.01) is an exoplanet orbiting the Sun-like star Kepler-452 about 1,402 light-years (430 pc) from Earth in the constellation Cygnus.  Earth is the only planet in the universe proven to sustain life (as we define it). The planet boasts several million species of life,  living in habitats ranging from the bottom of the deepest ocean to a  few miles into the atmosphere. And scientists think far more species  remain to be discovered.  As of March 2020, a total of 55 potentially habitable exoplanets have been found. 55 potentially habitable on a total of 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting in possibly habitable zones. This gives a probability of roughly 1.4x10(-9), that of the 40 billion Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting in habitable zones of Sun-like stars and red dwarfs within the Milky Way, one of them sustains life as we define it. That's like finding a needle in a haystack. Maybe in other galaxies than ours (the Milky Way), the estimate might be different, who knows?Moreover, if humanity ever finds life on an exoplanet, how will it look like? And will it be intelligent. It's my opinion that there are not much evolutionary pathways along which lifeforms can develop. Take the time needed on Earth needed for evolution to produce humans, which we consider as being intelligent, obviously because we defined the concept of intelligence (and IQ testing) ourselves. That's a bit of a self-fullfilling prophecy no?If we leave intelligence out of focus here, it took a lot of time for life to develop on Earth! Will that be possibly different on one or another exoplanet? I figger no!So we might bump on life in its evolutionary birth phase, or maybe lifeforms which have autonomous capacity and sensory capability, which it can interpret and trigger into some type of action. If we define that as intelligence, OK! But then humans on Earth are for sure not the only intelligent lifeforms on this planet. For an astronomer that's difficult stuff, for a biologist that's straightforward truth.Summarizing, the probability of discovering life on exoplanets is sheer zero, and the if we discover life on an exo-planet it will be a snapshot of the millions of years it takes for evolution to develop a lifeform with which we can communicate!Maybe we can train communication with the many lifeforms on Earth to begin with.

In particular, in the process of modeling from the point of view of information theory, there are no two interacting objects: the International System of Units (SI is the most widely used system of units), which \"supplies\" the model with information about the phenomenon under study using dimensional and dimensionless variables, and a researcher who chooses certain variables from SI, using intuition, knowledge and experience to determine the accuracy of the model.The amount of information transmitted and contained in the model, which, in turn, is created by the will of the observer, can play an unexpected and important role in assessing the attainable accuracy when representing the simulated phenomenon. The information method is not associated with external interference arising from experimental and measurement errors. This is largely due to the researcher's physico-philosophical approach to explaining the phenomenon under study.Regardless of the model, the goal of the information-based method is to quantify the disruptions in the transmission of information from the object of study to the observer, mainly by choosing the class of phenomena and the number of variables considered. The amount of information contained in the model is then used to determine the limits of its accuracy and develop methods to achieve the desired optimal comparative uncertainty. The comparative uncertainty of the model associated with the decision of the observer to choose a qualitative-quantitative set of variables gives the most appropriate estimate of the threshold discrepancy (Rabinovich, 2005) between the observed phenomenon and the model and is the fundamental limit of the measurement sensitivity. This limit prevents the use of any models with a low number of base quantities, especially in the context of macroscopic measurements of physical constants. In addition, the accuracy limit of any measurement, due to the choice of a qualitative-quantitative set of variables in the model for any system of units, is due to the worldview of the observer; there is a certain fundamental essence, more significant (strong) than the Heisenberg inequality, depending from the consciousness of the observer. Moreover, this limit is universal - it applies to everything. This uncertainty has always existed, and perhaps the limit allows researchers to accurately map the boundary that separates the quantum and classical worlds.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"2"},{"answer_post_date":"15th May, 2021","answer_content":"Boris Menin I don't understand why you had to respond in all different threads.

If the arc turns out to be real, it would challenge a bedrock assumption of cosmology: that on large scales, matter in the universe is evenly distributed no matter where you look.“It would overturn cosmology as we know it,” said cosmologist Alexia Lopez at a June 7 news conference at the virtual American Astronomical Society meeting. “Our standard model, not to put it too heavily, kind of falls through.”Lopez, of the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, England, and colleagues discovered the purported structure, which they call simply the Giant Arc, by studying the light of about 40,000 quasars captured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Quasars are the luminous cores of giant galaxies so distant that they appear as points of light. While en route to Earth, some of that light gets absorbed by atoms in and around foreground galaxies, leaving specific signatures in the light that eventually reaches astronomers’ telescopes (SN: 7/12/18).The Giant Arc’s signature is in magnesium atoms that have lost one electron, in the halos of galaxies about 9.2 billion light-years away. The quasar light absorbed by those atoms traces out a nearly symmetrical curve of dozens of galaxies spanning about one-fifteenth the radius of the observable universe, Lopez reported. The structure itself is invisible on the sky to human eyes, but if you could see it, the arc would span about 20 times the width of the full moon.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"4"},{"answer_post_date":"15th Jun, 2021","answer_content":"Thank you very much for your answers, comments, and links to interesting publications.

Many of them are quite unlike anything in our solar system. While astronomers hope to use immense upcoming observatories to get a better look at their outsides, Federica Coppari has been using the world’s largest laser to investigate their insides.Coppari compresses familiar substances, including rocks and water, into new forms. Her work has yielded insights into the inner workings of frozen giants such as Uranus and Neptune, as well as the potential habitability of super-Earths — rocky planets that dwarf our own.Two years ago, she and her colleagues confirmed the existence of “superionic ice,” a hot, black form of the normally chilly substance. This long-sought phase may be among the most common forms of ice in the universe, found inside ice giants both in our own solar system and elsewhere. The work has helped solve puzzles about such worlds’ magnetic fields.It’s here, where the terrestrial and the celestial meet, that Coppari thrives. “How our experiments in the laboratory can say something about what’s going on up there — that’s fascinating,” she said.Like many kids, Coppari went through a period where she wanted to be an astronaut. But guided by her teachers, she realized that she was more interested in figuring out “why things are the way they are, and why things happen the way they do.” That quest took her out of Appignano, the tiny town in Italy where she grew up, to Paris and then to the U.S., where she is currently a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California.There, she works with the National Ignition Facility, or NIF, a laser the size of three football fields. NIF was originally intended to help maintain the country’s stockpile of thermonuclear weapons and to pursue the dream of harnessing fusion for energy. Coppari uses the beam’s intense blasts to conduct laser-driven compression experiments. Each laser “shot” may last only a nanosecond, but it’s capable of recreating the pressure at the core of an enormous planet.More recently, she’s been part of a team that used the University of Rochester’s Omega Laser Facility to compress samples of iron oxide — one of the main constituents of our planet’s mantle — up to 7 million times Earth’s atmospheric pressure. Coppari and her colleagues were able to glean information that could be used to model super-Earth interiors, helping to figure out details about their magnetic fields, crustal movements, and perhaps even their suitability for living things.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"16th Jun, 2021","answer_content":"only on earth","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"","answer_content":"","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"26th Jul, 2021","answer_content":"An interesting discussion.

We present a cosmic perspective on the search for life and examine the likely number of Communicating Extra-Terrestrial Intelligent (CETI) civilizations in our Galaxy by utilizing the latest astrophysical information. Our calculation involves Galactic star formation histories, metallicity distributions, and the likelihood of stars hosting Earth-like planets in their habitable zones, under specific assumptions which we describe as the Astrobiological Copernican Weak and Strong conditions. These assumptions are based on the one situation in which intelligent, communicative life is known to exist—on our own planet. This type of life has developed in a metal-rich environment and has taken roughly 5 Gyr to do so. We investigate the possible number of CETI civilizations based on different scenarios. At one extreme is the Weak Astrobiological Copernican scenario—such that a planet forms intelligent life sometime after 5 Gyr, but not earlier. The other is the Strong Astrobiological Copernican scenario in which life must form between 4.5 and 5.5 Gyr, as on Earth. In the Strong scenario (under the strictest set of assumptions), we find there should be at least 📷 civilizations within our Galaxy: this is a lower limit, based on the assumption that the average lifetime, L, of a communicating civilization is 100 yr (since we know that our own civilization has had radio communications for this time). If spread uniformly throughout the Galaxy this would imply that the nearest CETI is at most 📷 lt-yr away and most likely hosted by a low-mass M-dwarf star, likely far surpassing our ability to detect it for the foreseeable future, and making interstellar communication impossible. Furthermore, the likelihood that the host stars for this life are solar-type stars is extremely small and most would have to be M dwarfs, which may not be stable enough to host life over long timescales. We furthermore explore other scenarios and explain the likely number of CETI there are within the Galaxy based on variations of our assumptions.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"4"},{"count":99}]],[{"question_post_date":"3rd Aug, 2019","question_title":"How poisonous are neonicotinoids (neonics) for honeybees in real practical world really?","question_image_url":null,"question_content":"Are neonics really tested for honeybees in real practical world really, that they are so letal that they should forbidden?Now after the prohibition of neonics, farmer suffer of a explosion of the CORN ROOT WORM  (Diabrotica virgifera).

Despite the economic recession in 2020, many construction investments were carried out, many apartments were commissioned, the investment processes of which were started in the previous few years. In addition, despite the downturn in the domestic economy, housing prices increased in 2020, in addition to falling prices of office space. If we take into account the issues of changes in international supply logistics and production growth in some industries in the context of a slowdown in economic activity in many service sectors, the economic situation in 2020 was exceptional.

Russia has a two-degree system of scientific degrees.

The second level is Doctor of Sciences (full doctor). And if for the first level 5 publications in peer-reviewed journals are enough, then for the second - 15. Usually, a person defends a candidate's thesis at the age of 25-28 (master's + postgraduate studies), and a doctoral dissertation is defended already at about 40-45 years. Previously, in Soviet times, there were such forms of defense as \"on the basis of the totality of works\" (without submitting a dissertation, colloquially called \"brick\"), now this is impossible.

On the other hand, I know a man who defended his PhD thesis at 63...

Particularly striking examples are given by modern politics. Many \"doctors\" occupy positions which not require scientific qualifications, but they have an advantage over those who do not bother to defend a dissertation, because there is a belief that the holder of a scientific degree is the best specialist. In Russia, there is the \"Dissernet\" society, which analyzes the dissertations of \"notable people\" and very often in such dissertations borrowings, plagiarism are found, up to rewriting chapters and entire works of predecessors. A few of these papers have come under public scrutiny, but this has no consequences for dissertators, only for their \"alma maters\" (called \"thesis factory\"), supervizors and dissertation councils.And age doesn't matter.

If the term \"inflation\" sounds \"a bit negative\" then maybe we should eliminate it from the field of Economics as well; perhaps use the expression \"very high rates of change in prices\" (and for the case at hand, \"in dates\"). One can sugar-coat a negative responses to the extent one wishes, and possibly make it sound even \"politically correct\"; this doesn't change the fact that it is a negative response, especially in its substance, which should matter more than the style used to express it. It would be of interest (at least for me) to discuss this issue (of C-14 dating archeological structures) more in detail. I have a number of comments on this topic, which I would love to bounce off of you. In summary, C-14 doesn't date structures, except in the (extremely rare) case where a sample, large enough for meaningful testing, has been collected from UNDER the structure, since \"fills do not date structures, and neither do contaminated and limited samples\". These multiple samples must be sent for analysis to at least two (possibly more) Labs, so one can get a statistically significant and reliable response. I know this is not an inexpensive proposition, but \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\" to become admissible. This has not been done in the cases with which I am somewhat familiar (including Gobekli Tepe).I'm considering writing a follow-up paper on this topic, and add it to my (six as of today) papers on the subject (Gobekli Tepe, and surrounding Neolithic sites of the Levant). I fully agree with you, that novel (and as numerous as possible) theories must be debated, evidence should be collected to the maximum extent; and all that (theory and evidence) ought to be thoroughly analyzed and evaluated, before firm conclusions are reached. Unfortunately, this proper scientific discourse and procedures haven't taken place in the case of Gobekli Tepe (in specific).

One is canonisation of early sources, eg Manetho, who strung together co-reigns in ignorance; and canonisation of Egypt in early humanities (David Rohl rectified this in the New Chronology of Greece etc). The other reason is the archetypal compulsion to seek grandness in ancestry, as in the Golden Age, and the need to escape the uncomfortable conscious evidence, and subconscious certainty, that there was no Golden Age. This contradiction involves the common or garden assumption of evolution, contradicted by data. Popular science magnifies the triple problem of 'evolution, ancient glory, canonical records', into fantastic dating. Ironically the truth could not enter science, and will never enter popular science, since it contradicts this paradigm. The irony is that maturity requires truth. Your case study could be Stonehenge dating and Gobekli dating. Both are dated by Stone Age soil, which do not date the monuments. Good luck with convincing any Brit that stone circles and megaliths are Bronze Age, and Stonehenge is post Roman. My guess for Gobekli, based on precedents in the region, is BC 6000s. I tried in a section of my book Stoneprint (2014) to bring the perspective of population density and the Dark Age to Stonehenge. Kindly visit www.stoneprintjournal.wordpress.com for an extract on Stonehenge. Also ironic that the solution to our conscious blinkers could come from conscious access to our own subconscious behaviour, which is taboo to the human sciences for the same reasons that sustain dating inflation.

If I understand your question correctly you're referring to the stock market crash of 2008. If my assumption is correct then I will answer based on that premise first of all I believe that after the 2008 stock market crash you never recovered the economy in the United States and other words after that point in 2008 when they gave the banks the hundreds of billions of dollars in bailouts what happened is the banks begin investing that money to make themselves wealthier. The bank's never used the 800 billion dollars to inject back into Main Street so that Main Street could invest and the middle class could strengthen and rise up because the middle class is in fact the economic engine of the United States. The middle class was left on their own and much of the middle class began to give up on investing in the stock market on their own and reverted to corporate money market funds like 401ks and things like that. That is approximately the point when precious metals took a nosedive and ever since then you've had an almost exponential rise in the value of the stock market which is many many times over valued above the profit and loss statements of Corporations. This was done because the banks realize they were over-leveraged and they had many many derivative funds that were stretching all of their debt far beyond sometimes in some cases over a hundred times leverage on the bank's assets and this was due to derivatives on top of derivatives. Now what I believe psychologically is happened is that in the last 10 or 11 years you have a new breed of employee and this new breed of employee came into the picture with a new reality and they accepted the reality as it was presented to them and as they exist in this new reality the stock market and the investment Market is completely fake and the reason why I can say that is that you have no discovery of the actual true value of the market there's no mechanism to actually discover what the true value of a particular asset is and the asset class of precious metals is being suppressed with paper derivatives of precious metals. Most employees that have a 401k also I don't really understand what they're investing in so they select from a menu of money markets and they understand that the higher the percentage of pre-tax dollars that they put into their 401K they're going to be receiving a higher tax return at the end of the year and as long as they continue to see exponential growth in the stock market they feel comfortable to put their pre-tax dollars into their 401K money market funds and just let it rise to the Moon. This could not be more false and many people are so over-leveraged and their money market funds as I said before in some cases a hundred times leverage that the smart thing for them to do is invest their money into physical tangible precious metals. Psychologically what is occurring is you have a nationwide herd mentality and it even crosses all political party lines whether you're liberal Democrat conservative or Republican it doesn't matter because this new paradigm the Paradigm that is now 11 years old has washed away all the old memories from 2008 and people think that they have recovered but it's not a true recovery it's only a recovery and numbers based on inflation size inflation continue to grow it appeared that things had more cost but they don't have more value the value has never recovered and the value in the system has always stayed the same but it looks like there's more cost so people are thinking that an item has increased in expense but it's only the depreciation of the dollar that has cost that item to have higher dollar amount but higher dollar amount is not equated to higher-value. Therefore to answer your question the capital significance is not a true indicator of the capital value and the capital value is still an overpriced feature and over-leveraged and the True Value which hasn't been discovered yet because we don't have an equal and open market in order to discover the true value of an asset many people are going to be losing a vast amount of their wealth that they will never be able to recover unless you have extreme hyperinflation in the future but likewise you would also have to have extreme hyper income increase in the future in order to keep up.

The efficient market hypothesis (EMH)—the idea that competitive financial markets exploit all available information when setting security prices—has been singled out for particular attention. Like all successful theories, the EMH has major limitations, even as it continues to provide the foundation for not only past accomplishment, but future advances in the field of finance.Despite the theory's undoubted limitations, the claim that it is responsible for the current worldwide crisis seems wildly exaggerated. This essay shows the misreading of the theory and logical inconsistencies involved in popular arguments that EMH played a significant role in (1) the formation of the real estate and stock market bubbles, (2) investment practitioners' miscalculation of risks, and (3) the failure of regulators to recognize the bubbles and avert the crisis. At the same time, the author argues that the collapse of Lehman Brothers and other large financial institutions, far from resulting from excessive faith in efficient markets, reflects a failure to heed the lessons of efficient markets. In the author's words, “To me, Lehman's demise conclusively demonstrates that, in a competitive capital market, if you take massive risky positions financed with extraordinary leverage, you are bound to lose big one day—no matter how large and venerable you are.”Finally, behavioral finance, widely considered as challenging and even supplanting efficient markets theory, is viewed in this article as complementing if not reinforcing efficient markets theory. As the author says, “it takes a theory to beat a theory.” Behavioralism, for all its important contributions to finance literature, is described as not a theory but rather “a collection of ideas and results”— one that depends for its existence on the theory of efficient markets....

In the first place I would like to point out some useful theorists. At first, It´s important to say, that my answer is strictly motivated by research in the field of aesthetics and after that by fine art and archeology also.In the notorious known publication Story Art, E. H. Gombrich writes about prehistoric art, and he comes with conclusions: (I am not citing) 1. If we would like to find some sorts of art comparing to ours age, that are collected and represented in the Galleries or Museums, we would definitely not find any, and we could say, that prehistory was without art.  2. But if we thing about some decorated clothes, sculptures or other cult paintings as a Works of Art, than we could speak about prehistoric art. So there is the point. It´s look like it is on recipient choice how he chose, but that´s not entirely correct. We must consider the role and place of “Rock Art” (or “Cave art” – which is not entirely correct after all because of the exterior engravings) in the History of Fine Art, which are already accepted. This though is not any conclusion, but just short side branch to think about. (Generally I work with artifacts of younger prehistory and protohistory, so my answer is limited by this research)On the second place, already mention notion “art” is not clearly defined, what is thanks to God not even possible, because it would limited the future works of Art. Interesting application of aesthetic, concrete of analytic aesthetic could be done with M. Weitz (inspired by Wittgenstein´s gender similarity) speaks about open and closed terms, e. g. the art is understood as open, because we can endless add some new features. On the other hand, he speaks about descriptive and evaluating usage of given term. We must also consider the original function of given “rock art” and change of they and understand it as a main factor in their evaluating. Also needed, I think, should be understanding of real intention and secondly (by recipient) implemented intention in the “rock art”. In this case, it could be not definitely say either if the prehistory artifacts are works of art, or are not and we should give main accent on the concrete context of creating and origin of the work. In this field is suitable and interesting work of W. Dawis analyzing (also using Wittgenstein´s thoughts) paintings and in general Paleolithic art from the view of used “signs”. Very interesting thoughts about “art” gives D. Lewis – Williams in the book Mind in the cave and speak about  “West origin” of this notion (as A. Colson already mention).

That’s the intention of making it public. The problems involved in rock art interpretation are complex. Rock art is always embedded in a specific cultural tradition. That’s why it is difficult, and in some cases inconvenient to generalize. Throughout twelve years of research in this field I have found out that rock art can have several different social functions: 1) mnemonic: a visual aid to remember oral traditions, mainly mythical; 2) territorial: used to define a territory belonging to a tribe, community or secret society; 3) ritual: it is part of a complex ceremony and it is produced in a sacred place; 4) documental: it’s aim is to represent a special social event that needs to be remembered; 5) cognitive: it is a means of preserving and transmitting specialized knowledge.Nonetheless, almost all objects made by traditional or archaic cultural traditions that, from a modern western point of view, can be defined as artistic, have three interdependent qualities: they are useful, they have a religious symbolic meaning and they have an aesthetic component. Although in many languages the word art doesn’t exist, there are many other words to describe beauty, or what is well and beautifully done, or what is precious or what is good enough to be praised. On the other hand, world known specialists like Jean Clottes, Ignacio Barandiarán and David Whitley have demonstrated the sophisticated painting and engraving methods that are present in the first known rock art expressions (32,000 BP) at Chauvet and other caves. As Whitley says since arte appeared for the first time it was fully developed and sophisticated: in form and content.

The few humans which are depicted can best be described as stick figures. Whether the rock art is dated to the Palaeolithic, Iron Age, or more recent times, it is important to take into account that the human brain is the same for all modern men; according to physical anthropologists, 1/10 persons now are left-handed, and the same percentage was also the case then.

There are far more artifacts and objects in the universe of art, so try to analyze something with criterion of beauty I think discriminates all others works of art. We need to have in mind, as already N. Goodman, E. H. Gombrich, W. Dawis and among others also G. Dorles said, that if something seems like to depicted something we know, the probability of our misjudgment is still present. Or rather, as N. Goodman said in the reaction of searching of realistic depictions, it’s always a consensus of imaging of each period. So if the humans were not so rich and various depicted as animals, it could be still the outcome of depiction agreement, and also the outcome of importance of the animals in the lives of prehistoric men. But I understand your opinion because Eddy M. Zemach in his No identification Without Evaluation said, that if we would like to define (identify) something we choose an exemplary object, not some degraded one. More interesting in this discussion, as Alice and Karen already stated are the notion \"art\" and \"rock art\" itself. What is an Art? Maybe silly question, but discourse of last periods shows us, that the answer is not so silly and simple and that in the context of the whole history of art, there’s no answer at all. Better say, no one answer applicable on whole history of art. Better question should look like: „What´s the difference between traditional, present and prehistoric or even ethnic art?” In this comparison we could gain some answer but still, it would be not sufficient. Why could we not define art in general? The answer is simple. Because the art is so complicated process and structure of different artifacts, and the notion of art was created by the western civilization. In the antique, the notion art was used in even on sport and even on gardening. So we can see, that the art itself is responsible for not to be defined. As Wittgenstein and Weitz said, it´s about use of the term, how is it correctly used and according to it, we should try to define it. But Monroe C. Bradley stated that the main problem in the last decades definitions of art is in this linguistic premises and we must agree (or least I agree), till there would be humanity there would be also wrong uses of the notion Art. And if we would try to analyze who should say how to use the terms, we are again in the Institutionalism. Other side of this problem, as Karen said: “there are no rules in art”. But is this principle of anarchy in art really the main cause of problem? J. Mukařovský (Czech esthetician and structuralist) try to define aesthetic norm and he come to conclusion, that the aesthetic norm is a dynamic process not a static dogma, or complex of used rules. In the eternal violations of norm we can see the main cause of endless development of the art and creating of new art. According to this, there is possibility, that we could never define art, but we could try to define art of closed and past historic periods. It´s a closed process and we could make some pattern of what is and what is not an art anymore. And if some new discoveries would be made, there would be still this pattern to consider where to define new objects. Other possibility is to distinguish beetwen art and artistic value of “rock art.”On the other hand, is this really necessary? Do we need strictly to define and violently apply the notion of Art? It´s just question to think about, not my answer, but there are possible two ways why not to use notion Art.  1.\tThe term is very narrow: according to history of art and to Dubufet, what we know and understand as the work of Art are only a small amount of artifacts of each period;2.\tThe term is very vide, if we look on today’s art, and today´s understanding of art. What is really important in my opinion is also already mentioned: contextual meaning of each “rock art” and original function of them. Why is it, that every single time, when is examined “rock art” we decline to ask of their origin or rather of their original meaning. There´s still possibility that we would not gain any answer but we need and we must to ask again and again. Because the function of object is that, what really defines him.

Eco stated. We need to think about it whenever we interpret something and always work with this conclusion. Other, hermeneutic, opinions says that there´s no limits in the process of interpretation. R. Shusterman wrote in reaction of this so cold “hermeneutic holism” very interesting paper “Beneath Interpretation: Against hermeneutic Holism” where he strictly criticizes the fact (or rather I should say opinion of most hermeneutists) that whenever a recipient interact with some artifact or reality, he interprets it. I must say, that I agree whit hermeneutic, but I still thing, there are limits and boundaries of interpretation. Because if we interpret something, that doesn´t mean, we interpret it correctly and in the line with needed context, but still the interpretation of recipient is present. I worked with similar thesis, when I try to interpret traco-scythian artifacts from Slovakia and later, when I try to identify communicative competencies of prehistoric artifacts, and I come to conclusions, that there are (I named it) two boundaries models of interpretation. Although the term model is not very correct in this use. I should say, there are two boundaries, which delimits the interpretation of prehistoric artifacts (and now I thing, the rock and prehistoric art also).

They have a rich tradition of petroglyphs which, I've learned, all have to do with their oral traditions, i.e., their \"myths\" (I prefer the term sacred narratives). Each place where there is a rock inscription or a set of them, there is a story told that explains the meaning of that inscription. More, the whole set of rock sites are arranged in such a way as to  reproduce the principal episodes of the entire creation story. Thus, the principal sites in this - what I call -  'mythscape' are ordered along an axis from west to east, beginning with the site where shamans received their knowledge and power, followed by the site where the world came into being, then the first initiation rite, and finally the place where death came into the world. Each site is a complex arrangement of rock inscriptions and a seemingly ordered arrangement of the rocks and boulders. So, in all of this, where is the 'art' ? The discussion in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/art-definition/) leaves no doubt that these petroglyphs are Art. Insofar as all are linked to the native understanding of what is sacred, the meaning attributed to them enhances their beauty. More than this, the ordered arrangement of these sites coincide with the indigenous understanding of their territory (lands), their world, the limits of their cosmos. As in native North America, where you have whole regions such as the Black Hills constituting a sacred territory for the Lakota and other peoples, the peoples of the Northwest Amazon  believe that the entire set of sacred places (where the petroglyphs are) constitute their 'story'. Since stories, as told, are an art form for the native peoples, it is reasonable to conclude that the rock inscriptions, seen as a whole, likewise constitute a purposeful composition and not simply a disconnected set. This is reflected in the telling of the creation story as well, which is an art, and the meanings attached to each of the stories.Shamans are masters of world-making (see N. Goodman, J. Overing); indeed, every journey they make to the Other World is an artful reconstruction with a purpose.

I think that you’re walking in circles and we’re getting nowhere. From your point of view rock art would be the same as any other artifact and that is not true. Although many artifacts of Premodern or traditional societies have the three dimensions we defined: usefulness, religious symbolism and an aesthetic value, the important question for anthropology is understanding the differential and specific meaning of each kind of artifact for each particular social group. From my point of view, it is evident that the Paleolithic marvelous paintings of caves like Chauvet (32,000 to 26,000 BP) or from Altamira or Lascaux cannot be treated, theoretically in the same manner as a spear point. We need to know that there are different accents in their symbolic meaning and aesthetic quality. In these cases, as well as in the case I study of the rock art in the Sonoran Desert, or, for example, in the case of the Freemont rock art of Utah, or of the Barrier Canyon rock art of North America: there is a very important aesthetic component, associated directly with their religious function that cannot be denied.Although in many languages we do not find the word art, we still can find words that make direct references to the beauty and perfection in the elaboration of things, especially referred to poetry, painting or sculpture. For example, in the Nahuatl language of ancient Mexico we find the word yectli used by the king and poet Netzahualcóyotl to refer to “the beautiful chants” of the poet Tezozomoctizin; the poet Tlaltecatzin uses the word: yectla to speak about “the precious jade objects that were created with art”. In the Nahuatl language yecti or yectli are used to describe things that are done with excellence; yectencualoni: things that have a quality that should be praised.We can find many other examples all over the world. Robert Layton in his famous book: The Anthropology of Art, presents many examples: “The attitude of the Kalabari towards their sculptures does not imply that this culture has no art forms. According to Horton they put their aesthetic creativity and expressive skills into the dances which form another aspect of the spirit cult” (1991:8). As well, between the Lega of Zaire the owners and users of masks claim that they are Busoga, good and beautiful (1991:10). Also referred to the Lega tradition: “[…] the lega have words which express the aesthetic appeal of the finest carvings. Some of these terms associate beauty with order; kukonga: to produce harmony and unison in singing together; kwengia: to be shinny like a well-polished chair or statue; kwanga: to be good in order to like a country that shrives; kuswaga: to be at peace” [1991:13).If you compare these terms to those used by the artists and theorists of art of the Italian Renaissance, like Alberti, da Vinci, Lucca Paccioli or Albretch Durer, when they refer to the composition of a painting or to the design of a sculpture or a building: they have a lot in common.Best,Julio","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"22nd Oct, 2014","answer_content":"I agree with Julio on this as I work in the Valley of Oaxaca.

This paper explores the likelihood that many of the panels of petroglyphs decorating the orthostats and kerbstones at sites such as Knowth, Newgrange and Dowth, simply depict the monuments that were constructed during the Neolithic and Early Bronze Ages. The spatial distribution of the motifs on the stones at Knowth, Newgrange and Dowth for example, were a way of drawing in the wider ritual landscape, creating for the community a way of connecting the physical landscape, with the realm of the dead.”“Though many of the monuments within the Boyne Ensemble are still visible in the landscape, there are hundreds of sites where nothing can be seen, except for the panels that exhibit this enigmatic art, with hundreds more yet to be discovered.  With the advances in geo-prospecting technology, and using the probable cartographic information on the panels, undiscovered sites and monuments beckon.”(NOTE: the foreword was edited Dr. George Nash, an expert in Neolithic art at the University of Bristol)More importantly, the panels are the only surviving historical records of these sites, with the wealth of artifacts and remains they’ll eventually yield, shedding fresh light on who constructed them, their age and chronology, thus opening a new chapter in their history.My three papers can be accessed online at:https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sean_MoriartyThree additional articles and two short films can be accessed online at:https://independent.academia.edu/SeanMoriarty","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"19th Jun, 2015","answer_content":"Sean, thank you for your answer. I have always agreed that rock art is multifunctional and that it cannot be understood from a single point of view or a one dimensional hypothesis. Anthropology is the science that studies human diversity, the particular aspects of each specific culture, in the first place. That’s why rock art has to be studied within its cultural framework. Ethnography and ethnohistory are a fundamental aid to the interpretation of archaeological data. I am not a structuralist, but if have found in my research that you can find common patterns that are present in many examples of rock art, all over the world. Aside from its various functions, the artistic or aesthetic element is there.All throughout human history, at least beginning in the Late Paleolithic, human beings have produced a very wide range of objects with artistry. They are created with an outstanding craftsmanship, being beautiful, efficient in their practical function, and the material support of spiritual symbolic meaning. Nonetheless, several researchers think that the concept art can only be applied to the “Western cultural tradition”–being the term, in itself ethnocentric-, obviously, their point of view is either naïve, dogmatic or ethnocentric.Best,Julio","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"21st Jun, 2015","answer_content":"Julio,Regardless of the meaning of rock art, I agree with you that the artistic element is there. As for the aesthetic… no, at least not with respect to the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age rock art In Ireland, the UK and France.  While rock art may be multifunctional, I think that depends a great deal on the culture responsible for the art, and to some extent the time period in which it was executed.  You stated that “Ethnography and ethnohistory are a fundamental aid to the interpretation of archaeological data.”  Though I disagree with Robert Bednarik on a great many points, I have to agree with him that ethnographic interpretation of rock art has some major pitfalls.http://www.ifrao.com/ethnographic-interpretation-of-rock-art/http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifrao.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F06%2FEthnoAnalogy.doc&ei=5BiHVcrZF4bgoAS0lZW4Dg&usg=AFQjCNFLD31H4O6AAiAthGYZCUEVDVHFOw&bvm=bv.96339352,d.cGUKevin Callahan also discusses the matter, though he’s less cautious about the use of ethnography than Bednarik.http://www.tc.umn.edu/~call0031/folklore.htmlOne of the many pitfalls of ethnography, is that it relies heavily on folklore.  As the folklore of a given culture can stretch back in time thousands of years, and hundreds of generations, as in the case of say the Australian aborigines, the meaning of the motifs have no doubt been distorted to one degree or another.  To draw a simple analogy, I remember when I was in grade school we played a game called ‘Telephone’, where the teacher would make up a very simple one sentence story, which she’d tell student #1.  By the time the story had made its way around to student #30, it barely resembled the original story told student #1.  Now that took place in the course of few minutes, so you can imagine how distorted a story became over the course of several thousand years.Even when there are ‘historical records’, those are, depending on the culture and time period, extremely unreliable because in many cases those ‘records’ were either written centuries after the fact, and/or by ‘outsiders’ who were interpreting the events they witnessed from their point of view, not that of the culture they were observing.  Take for example the Roman historians who were writing about the different cultures that inhabited Britain and Ireland during the Early Christian Age.All that being said, there’s a site in Ireland called the Hill of Tara, which dates to around 3000 BC.  The site is comprised of several dozen earthen monuments, and while some are still visible in the landscape, most have only been detected by geo-physical survey.  Based on the ‘historical records’, which in this case are the Dindshenchas Erenn, and the Rennes and Metrical Dindshenchas, the earliest of which date to the 6th Century, if memory serves me correctly, Dr. Petrie in 1837 was able to match the descriptions and names of the monuments to their location on the hill.  Based on the names of the monuments, all of which are in Gaelic, and their history as recorded in the Annals, archaeologists believe that most if not all, with the exception of the Mound of the Hostages – a small passage mound on the hill – date from 500 BC to around 500 AD.  The problem with ‘Dating by Name’, is that there were a number of other cultures who inhabited Ireland prior to the arrival of the Celts around 500 BC.  What do you think the odds are that over the course of 3,000 years, not to mention different cultures and hundreds of generations, that any of the earliest history and folklore surrounding the site got passed down?  As Winston Churchill said, “History is written by the victors”.Based on the panel of motifs found on Orthostat L.2 within the Mound of the Hostages, the core monuments on the Hill of Tara, of which there are twelve (12) that I discuss in my paper, date to between 3000 to 2500 BC, and all predate the Mound of the Hostages, as it’s simply not depicted on the panel.  In short, their anywhere from 2,000 to 3,500 years older than believed, and were simply repurposed over time.Aside from the Hill of Tara, there are dozens of other sites/monuments in Ireland and the UK that have been tentatively dated to the Iron and Roman Ages, either based on the ancient texts, or simply their similarity to monuments which have been dated through excavation, a number of which I discuss in ‘Petroglyphs: The Bend in the Boyne’ and ‘Petroglyphs: The Art of Ancient Landscapes’.As for the panels of art, there are no written records as to the meaning of the motifs, nor are there any indigenous cultures that can be traced back to 3000 BC, that can tell us what the motifs mean.  So the speculations by the archaeologists and anthropologists tell us nothing about the meaning of the motifs, rather they simply reveal the mindset of those interpreting them, which is another point on which I agree with Bednarik.  This gets back to the issue I raised in my earlier post, that none of their speculations have ever been tested, nor can they ever be tested.So what does all this mean?  It means that based on the questionable history of the sites, and the misinterpretation of the panels, that for the past 300 years since the advent of modern archaeology, the archaeologists and anthropologists whether they specialize in the Mesolithic, Neolithic up through the Medieval, got it wrong.  So much of the ‘history’ of the sites has been fabricated.The sad part about all of this, is that each subsequent generation of archaeologists and anthropologists, at least in Ireland, the UK and France, going back 300 years have simply accepted, for the most part, the work of those who came before them, especially when it comes to the meaning of the motifs.  The end result of which is an inverted pyramid, the foundation of which is not based on facts.  The only surviving historical records from the Neolithic and Early Bronze Ages in Ireland, the UK and France, which are literally carved in stone, are the panels of art.  Unfortunately, the archaeologists have never been able to ‘connect the dots’… or in this case the cups and rings.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"24th Jun, 2015","answer_content":"I completely agree with you: ethnography and ethnohistory are only an aid and, of course, meaning changes throughout history. The specific cultural meaning of most of the rock art has been lost forever, particularly in the case of cultural groups that disappeared without leaving an oral or written tradition that can help us to understand the meaning of rock art. Ethnography and ethnohistory allow us to formulate hypothesis that are useful as approximations, when used properly, especially in the cases where we can find a long term tradition. Yes, we need to read between lines to find how the epistemological point of view of the anthropologist is mixed with the testimonies of interviewed informers and how reliable are such informers. I also agree with you in that I disagree with Bednarik’s point of view. I had an argument with him, concerning the problem of interpretation, at IFRAO, a couple of years ago. I demonstrated, from a hermeneutical point of view, that even the hardest scientific data needs interpretation and that, in fact, the same scientific data has been interpreted in many different ways by different scientists. We always guide our interpretation by theoretical frameworks that are cultural and historical products; we project our categories of thought to the data that is being interpreted.

Abstract thinking revolves around language, mathematics, science and social studies.  As there is no evidence that the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age inhabitants of Ireland and the UK had a written language, let alone a mathematical system, nor any type of science, beyond calculating the position of the sun and moon at specific times of the year, nor any form of social studies, that interpretation simply doesn’t hold water, yet it’s been suggested that abstract thinking stretches back in time some 77,000 years.  However, this speculation is based solely on the researcher’s interpretation of the art being abstract, merely because the symbols are not recognizable as ‘subject matter’ existing in our surroundings.https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/02/pr0202.htmGiven that majority of the panels dating to the Early Bronze Age found in Scandinavia consist almost entirely of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic designs, they in all probability depict events, whether real or imagined. Having said that, I seriously question why the artists responsible for carving those panels, would have included abstract/geometric motifs.  It’s more likely they depict structures or monuments.With regards to the art being highly-stylized, it’s no more so than children’s art, which is due not to any intentional choice on their part, but rather their undeveloped artistic skills. This was no doubt the case with the artists during the Neolithic and Early Bronze Ages, something which was likely magnified by the stone tools they employed, and the medium on which the motifs were carved. Though shamans have existed in other cultures, places and times, “absolutely nothing proves the existence of shamans during the Irish Neolithic, nor practices of this kind related to the collective tombs of this period.” (Robin, 2008)","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"9th Jul, 2015","answer_content":"Sean:In the case I study of northwestern Mexico, I have discovered that the elements that would be called abstract figures are symbols, mainly religious, the incorporate many complex mythological concepts, what Leroi-Gourhan calls mythograms.

Standpoint feminism would here be useful in identifying the perspectival bias of the questioners and answerers.The utility of archaeology and different scales of time, place and peopleArchaeology is perhaps useful in expanding our frames of reference. For many people, especially gatherer-hunters it seems rock art was not primarily considered art, or even representation. Rather in many cases what we call the image or depiction, seems to have been considered an entity unto itself, sometimes even a more-than-human being. Wandjina/Wanjina rock art of Australia's Kimberley has a rich ethnography on this; southern African forager rock arts' use of rock features suggests a knowledge of a realm beyond the painted rock wall that housed various beings that at times are present on the rock and so on.This is not to say the producers of the 'rock art' did not enjoy this creation aesthetically and in other ways, and can be studied using formal art historicla methods (rarely done) in tandem with archaeological contextual analysis, but that may not have been the primary motivation.Further, in our ocular-centric studies we tend to isolate the image, ignoring the process of, for example, sourcing and mixing pigments and/or assembling the physical and social resources to produce an 'image'.This is why Tacon and Chippindale suggested 'rock-art' (hyphenated) as a portmanteau term.I quite like that we are constantly dissatisfied with 'rock art' adequately naming that entity we study/are drawn to - as we may never have an adequate term, and efforts to homogenise very different 'rock art' practices seems a hallmark of a universalising science at best - and imperial/colonial one at worst. Indeed, we face a fundamental incommensurability - trying to use 'words' to understand 'images'.Quo vadis?Turning our gaze to the present and future, would we call graffiti art (many do) or modern 'rock art' (not many do)?So, I don't think it useful to assume 'rock art' exists, but 'rock arts' certainly do, each to be studied in their context, which then allows us to step back and ask these larger questions.For what it is worth (if anything)","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"3"},{"answer_post_date":"29th Mar, 2021","answer_content":"If authors would not consider rock art to be art, they would be badly advised to call it rock art.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"2"},{"answer_post_date":"2nd Apr, 2021","answer_content":"Thank you, Sven: very good answer. I’ve always thought that anthropology is a science of particular cases. Throughout decades we have learned to adopt a basic attitude of humility: try to understand the specific cases within their own cultural framework. Universalistic and Eurocentric perspectives have failed to develop adequate answers to anthropological questions. The recent ethnographic studies, specially those referred to the so called “animistic ontologies” of Amazonia and Siberia, as well as those that study the aboriginal traditions of Australia, have brought new light to our understanding of those societies, still labeled with old Eurocentric concepts like “animism” and “totemism”.I agree that there is not a universal answer to this question. Nonetheless, it is a good question if we understand, as Robert Layton has proposed in his book The Anthropology of Art, that we have to adopt a different approach towards the meaning of “art”, depending on the society that we pretend to understand. Some societies don’t even have a word for what modern Europeans have called art.

Art is not conscious logical meaning (and where it tries to be, as in Communist propaganda, it fails). Art is not beauty, and where it tries to be, it becomes decor (which has some minor artistic functions) or kinds of porn (instant gratification, attempted appropriation). Among the social functions of art is appropriation of several classes of resources (time, place, identity, supremacy) on behalf of several classes of assumed peers of the artist (nation, tribe, clan, epoch, age group, guild, etc). Art walks a fine line between the many traps of attitude it usually falls into. I remain amazed at the consist re-expression of the five layers of archetypal structure, as a subconscious prerequisite for being art, by prodigies, masters and novices alike.

On the other hand overpopulation driven frameworks like the ecological overshoot idea can exist independently of the nature of the market structures(MP, C, P) that serve them.If we look at the system stability issue from the sustainability point of view/systematic point of view, both the UN/UNEP framework and the ecological overshoot framework are partial, independent views of the system stability issue, which leads to different root causes and consequences affecting system stability.These frameworks exist and work simply because they assumed the other framework does not matter, but the truth is that both frameworks matter if they are in the same plane, a plane that is reached when you eliminate “the independence or neutrality assumption between market structure and population dynamics” as we know that responsible market prices(irresponsible market prices) lead to responsible production and consumption(irresponsible production and consumption), which shaped the nature of responsible populations (irresponsible populations) that do not overshoot(that overshoot) affecting system stability positively(negatively).The case of irresponsible market pricing associated with Adam Smith’s traditional market since 1776 has in the end today led to over consumption, over production, and over population and to the environmental problems at the heart of negative system stability. In other words, irresponsible market prices leads to irresponsible populations and responsible market prices lead to responsible populations…..Under no neutrality assumptions both the UN/UNEP framework and the ecological overshoot idea do not work as they are set up as now the nature of the root cause, of consequences and of impacts on system stability depend on the nature of the market price.That is why I think that the nature of market structure dynamics shapes the nature of population dynamics, and therefore the nature of the impact on system stability.

More deeply, I would say that we  are at  the sunny side of life when we live in harmony with ourselves, the others, and even the universe. I find the following poem in the NET. I consider it to be a nice definition of what you are looking for and a nice illustration the above mentioned harmony:   \"Keep On The Sunny Side\"There's a dark and a trouble side of lifeThere's a bright and a sunny side tooThough we meet with the darkness and strifeThe sunny side we also have in view.So keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny sideKeep on the sunny side of lifeIt will help you everyday it will brighten all the wayIf you'll keep on the sunny side of life.Oh the storm in its fury broke todayCrushing hopes that I cherish so dearClouds and storms will in time pass awayAnd the sun again will shine bright and clear.So keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny sideKeep on the sunny side of lifeIt will help you everyday it will brighten all the wayIf you'll keep on the sunny side of life.Let us greed with a song of hope each dayThough the moments be cloudy or fairLet us trust at our Saviour always will keep usEveryone in his care.So keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny sideKeep on the sunny side of lifeIt will help you everyday it will brighten all the wayIf you'll keep on the sunny side of life...","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"16th Feb, 2017","answer_content":"Thanks for the Insight.

Generalization of results can be translated into bias in a study due to the different variables from subjects to concentration and dosage of drugs, animals and animal room situation, and most importantly epigenetic factors.Meanwhile, heterogeneous samples are not often desirable because of the problematic extent of variability which they exert in results, leading to less reliable statistics. Heterogeneity in medical and biological research in terms of comprehensiveness can be achieved by including different control and treatment groups for a population to analyze all possible circumstances in a comparative mode to eliminate bias.

If they have an abnormal gene, men are also just as likely to pass it on to both their daughters and their sons. Men with an abnormal BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene are 80 times more likely to develop breast cancer than men who don't have an abnormal gene. Breast cancer in men without an abnormal gene is rare. So a woman who has a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer on her father's side (her dad's mother or sisters) has the same risk of having an abnormal breast cancer gene as a woman with a strong family history on her mother's side.Still, a study suggests that women are much more likely to be referred for genetic counseling if the family history of breast or ovarian cancer is on their mother's side rather than their father's.This could mean that doctors aren't recognizing that paternal (father's) family history of breast and ovarian cancer is equally important as maternal (mother's) family history when considering abnormal breast cancer gene risk. It's also possible that women themselves don't consider paternal family history equal to maternal family history when talking about risk and family history with their doctors.https://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/20101024Any comments?","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"13th Jul, 2019","answer_content":"We have been into aggression research and female mice do not display aggression in the same way as males do.

One part can be replaced but other cannot be done. Practically organ can be transplanted but body cannot be rebuilding fully. Due to complexity of our body, cells do not allow changing them fully. One replaced another might have problem in rebuilding.The our body is just like a remarkable biological machine that is always supported and maintained by well-structured body systems and their unique organs, all contributing in different ways to the biological, physical, mental, and emotional health of a human being. In our body, a hundred trillion cells, 60 miles of blood vessels, a 3-pound brain with 50 to 100 billion nerve cells and amazing thinking capacity, and 2.5 billion heart beats in a life time of 75 years, to name a few of its unique characteristics. One of scientists have shared one idea and this is “Couldn’t the brain be situated in the chest cavity, near the heart instead in the head? There is another factor—if the brain was in the chest, it would be far less vulnerable to injury”. Our human bodies evolved in a very different era, under different environmental conditions.Certain organs to be useless, it is important to note that “useless” does not necessarily mean the same thing as a vestige of evolution. A vestige is a trace of something that existed generations ago. Something can be of use and still a vestige, as long as the use is greatly diminished. For example, nipples on males are not a vestige since they did not appear on ancestors which had functional male nipples. On the other hand, human body hair, which is a vestige, is not useless because it is known to aid in the detection of ectoparasites. Most important is that, which organ (or organs) in an adult human body is able to regenerate naturally, to the extent that a living person can donate part of this organ to someone else, and within several weeks the two parts of this organ will regenerate into functioning, near-normal-sized organs?But one possibility is there in humans with non-injured tissues, the tissue is naturally regenerated over time; by default these tissues have new cells available to replace expended cells. For example, the body regenerates a full bone within 10 years, while non-injured skin tissue is regenerated within two weeks. Every seven years (or 10, depending on which story you hear) we become essentially new people, because in that time, every cell in your body has been replaced by a new cell. In humans with non-injured tissues, the tissue is naturally regenerated over time; by default these tissues have new cells available to replace expended cells. Some patients who have a diseased portion of their liver removed are unable to regrow the tissue and end up needing a transplant.Ashish","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"count":7}]],[{"question_post_date":"4th Jun, 2019","question_title":"Is it reasonable to count gender studies among the sciences?","question_image_url":null,"question_content":"Recently, on RG there were discussions whether history is part of the sciences and if medicine is a case of applied sciences.

So this reasoning of mine could eventually be rephrased as: Are there common paradigms in gender studies that are qualitatively more critical than paradigms in other fields?Best,Thomas Neusius","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"17th Jun, 2019","answer_content":"Dear Thomas Neusius,I shall confine my contribution to the last part of her speech, which is linked to a question. (Are there common paradigms in gender studies that are qualitatively more critical than paradigms in other fields?)In my opinion, this question is formulated in a very factual way and allows a good discussion to be expected, also with the participation of experts to whom I do not belong. I only have experience in relation to children's games, gender roles and toy preferences (and parents who bought toys), also some experience in aspects of \"Bildung\". If we add to this the differences between the social classes and certain age limits of the children of the parents interviewed, e.g. 4-6 years, then at the beginning of the 1970s very interesting results were obtained which may look different today in the IT and media age. My findings at that time (volume \"Spielzeug-Sozialschichtt-Erziehung\", 1974) had among other things the result that despite all progressive attitudes of middle class parents the basic result had not changed much: that quite traditional role conceptions prevailed. This means that girls of this age preferred social games (with dolls and social design elements), while boys preferred more constructive, manual and technical aspects. The furnishing of the children's rooms is accordingly. Of course, this depends on the culture. In the GDR, things were different, supposedly. In any case, today's kindergartens are very much looking for equal rights here (the problem does not arise in the Montessori Children's House because the \"material\" is gender-neutral. Today's screenplay dominance has brought a variety of video games onto the market, in the areas of aggression, war games, SF horror games, etc. However, this has not led to this area being preferred by girls, where male interest is dominant. In spite of all cultural influences, evolutionary structures will probably also be effective in us. At that time in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when West Germany tried to create a uniform structure for public education in West Germany in the West-Eastern educational race through the \"Structure Plan for Education\" (1970), after the Education Act of the GDR of 1965 perceived the educational progress of the East with a certain longing (and in the background the Sputnik-Shock!\") The promotion of the social underclass played a role in the public discussion, the demand for female equality in education, economy, society, was not completely ignored;   but feminism in Germany began with American female authors - such as Kate Millett - being relevant, so that at the beginning of the seventies the (criticized precarious) social situation of the female sex was discussed primarily in three areas: The woman as (a) sexual object of the mane, (b) the woman fostered only to live with the tree K (Kinder, Küche Kirche), in the traditional social role of to ber house wife, serving the husband and raising children (for which the secondary school leaving certificate was regarded as completely sufficient for girls) , (c) the woman as disadvantaged in the higher educational qualifications. This was the first time a relatively independent, public culture of women had been created, who were quite \"ruthlessly open\" with men, at least critically. The poorer pay of women in the economy for the same overall performance has remained an issue to this day. This is different in the case of universities, since the law makes the preference of women in the case of equal qualifications the norm and the \"women's representatives\" (die \"Gleichstellungsbeauftragte\") - as you yourself know - can overturn any appointment list and influence any minister of education and cultural affairs in the granting of a call, even if the appointment process in the university senate has already been completed, if the \"equal opportunities representative\" complains about something. Of course, it is interesting to note the change in our language through the introduction of nouns with female endings where the female gender has been subsumed under the male gender. Feminist theologians have also done this to the horror of both great churches with \"God\" and with the \"Holy Spirit\" - whether successful, I do not know. It is difficult for me to decide whether in one area of scientific discussion, such as gender research, there is more criticism and controversy than in other areas. I believe there are always only certain questions that are discussed particularly emotionally in the media.  As far as the equalisation of educational qualifications is concerned, the situation has reversed: in absolute terms, we have had more female than male school-leavers. Women will not be able to resolve their fundamental conflict between children/family on the one hand and professional careers on the other, but it is a real pleasure today to promote opportunities to combine the two.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"2"},{"answer_post_date":"1st Feb, 2020","answer_content":"Thomas Neusius I think most of the serious scientists who work within the field of gender studies (GS) wouldn't deny aspects of biology regarding gender, but what is largely criticised are biologistic/deterministic or essentialistic views on the topos of gender, sexuality and gender-identiy etc..

The transfer process works well with willing or unwilling learners. The nature of the pedagogy is direct knowledge transmission. Very useful for learning clearly defined knowledge. No room for “discussion” or “uncertainty”. A one way process.Demands a high level of pedagogic skill. This is an expert teacher. They can develop a critical perspective in learners. They tightly structure the learning without the learner being aware of it. They “teach” through dialogue. They ask more than they tell.Chaos.The learner is treated to rigid teaching. Little of value is delivered by rote. Learners gain no critical skills or knowledge. The “Learning arena” is about the exercise of power rather than learning and empowerment. Of course each of the above cannot be offered as desirable or undesirable. “C +D” are probably of no use but we need to consider the different contexts in which the above may be deployed.

I believe there are a number of considerations in determining which of these approaches may be more effective, including the socio-cultural context and the personal experiences of each student.  Where students have experienced trauma, an authoritarian approach may yield compliance, but learning would be blocked by the students' Affective Filter (Krashen, 1985).  On the other hand, an authoritarian approach, where boundaries are clear, respect is modeled, and students feel safe to take risks in their learning - that would be an effective learning environment.My perspective is colored by my work in language acquisition, but I can't imagine that it would be any different when learning math, science, or social studies.  ","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"9th Jun, 2017","answer_content":"Dear Arne Matthias Krüger,  David Evans, Joanie Monroy,You have given me clear answers.Thank you so much.Litart","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"9th Jun, 2017","answer_content":"Dear Adrian Mee, Peter John Curtis, David Evans, vasudeva rao b.s,Thank you ever so much for your answers.Litart","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"9th Jun, 2017","answer_content":"It's been a pleasure Liart. kind regards.

Take for example X=(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and Y=(6, 7, 8, 9, 10.1). The CV from the linear regression is very low.

I believe Refik's data is a good example that why such regression methods are not well suited for an agreement study.

All of these upward-reaching architectural design features cause the eye to turn toward the heavens, the mind to be directed to spiritual meditation, contemplation of religious ideals, and to God. Thus, architecturally, theologically, and psychologically, medieval Gothic places strong emphasis  on elemental air and vast spaces, in contrast to earthbound materialism and concrete physical reality, as well as emphasis on elemental fire, symbolizing religious fervor and Christ's Passion, traceable to pagan rites and rituals involving worship of the Sun, moon, and stars. In marked contrast, contemporary churches tend to hire architects whose designs are geared more toward practical considerations and very little attention, if any, is devoted to coordinating the spiritual function of houses of worship with their architectural design. Indeed, the altar is a focal point yet is eclipsed by all of the ground space that is designated for the congregation of worshippers, which indicates a  concern that is more humanistic, almost a throwback to Pre-Christian and Pre-Greco Roman times, but still in marked contrast to the shrines and temples of Kyoto, Japan.If I knew how to \"copy-and-paste\" photographs from the Internet to illustrate my answer given above, I would provide you with some examples of the Gothic architectural style, with which you may already be familiar.

Many cultures devote considerable resources to their sacred architecture, and their places of worship, religion, and sacred spaces are among the most influential and man-made permanent stone buildings. Sacred architecture, on the other hand, as a place for Trans-intimacy, may also be disintegrated, unsustainable, and very personal, private, and non-public.Spiritual, religious and sacred buildings have usually emerged over the centuries and were the largest buildings in the world before modern skyscrapers.

Naming plants after people is an old practice that went out of fashion because it is much more useful to assign a name based on morphological characters.  However, even those can be confusing as the same character may later prove either unimportant to seperating taxa, such as an environmental response, or common to more than one taxon in a group.  For example, 'hirsuta' may later be found to apply to more than one species in the same genus or only apply to a species when it is growing at a high altitudes and not always.  I agree, renaming taxa for historical reasons alone would add to the confusion.   Sometimes, a useful thing about location names is the historical meaning, the first place this taxon was found by the person who assigned and published the organism's Latin name.  However, this can raise the hackles of those whose ancestors already knew the plant from somewhere else.  Also, land boundries shift.  Many organisms carry the species name 'virginiana' from when the Virginia Territory included most of then known North America.  Today Virginia is a much smaller area.  Also, I agree that location names can cloud understanding of an organism's real range and if close relatives overlap geographically.

What Linnaeus did in his system was abandoning a plethora of local (=indigenous) names. Linnaeus’ Systema Naturae was mostly dealing with European species and as such he wiped thousands of European “indigenous” names off. In Europe the same species has often a different name not only depending on the country but often depending on the town/village or the valley or the small island (and this is normally true also elsewhere in the world). Nobody in Europe complains that local (=indigenous) names have been “shadowed” by scientific names. People are free to use local/indigenous names in their daily life but when switching to science they know that there is another language to follow, ie., scientific nomenclature. I don’t see any reason why this should not work outside Europe. Are “indigenous” people of Africa, Oceania, etc. different from us?2) as regards the second issue: I don’t see anything bad about naming species after people. It’s an habit as old as scientific nomenclature and I don’t see any valid reason to abandon it. We still have millions of species to be named and relying exclusively on morphology for chosing their names would greatly limit our imagination and envetually would make remembering names more difficult. I suppose that you are aware that in zoological and botanical literature there is a fluorishing publishing of books on the etymology of zoological and botanical names and having patronymic is often felt much more entertaining than having only boring morphological names. The claim that some recipients of names were bad guys (of course, based on your own values) and that therefore we must “punish” them by eliminating those names is nonsensical. The past is the past and we cannot change history. Furthermore it would be utterly presumptuous to think that our values are the truth and that therefore we are entitled to judge other people and their political, religious or cultural habits and beliefs.3) As regards      your claim that naming species based on our cultural view is “antropocentric”,      this is another extremely questionable point. Honestly: do we have any      other point of view which is not ours (and therefore antropocentric)? The answer is obviusly not. We are      the only intelligent organisms on this planet and we are the only ones who      have created a complex language, which requires to have names for every      animal and plant.

What Linnaeus did in his system was abandoning a plethora of local (=indigenous) names. Linnaeus’ Systema Naturae was mostly dealing with European species and as such he wiped thousands of European “indigenous” names off. In Europe the same species has often a different name not only depending on the country but often depending on the town/village or the valley or the small island (and this is normally true also elsewhere in the world). Nobody in Europe complains that local (=indigenous) names have been “shadowed” by scientific names. People are free to use local/indigenous names in their daily life but when switching to science they know that there is another language to follow, ie., scientific nomenclature. I don’t see any reason why this should not work outside Europe. Are “indigenous” people of Africa, Oceania, etc. different from us?2) as regards the second issue: I don’t see anything bad about naming species after people. It’s an habit as old as scientific nomenclature and I don’t see any valid reason to abandon it. We still have millions of species to be named and relying exclusively on morphology for chosing their names would greatly limit our imagination and envetually would make remembering names more difficult. I suppose that you are aware that in zoological and botanical literature there is a fluorishing publishing of books on the etymology of zoological and botanical names and having patronymic is often felt much more entertaining than having only boring morphological names. The claim that some recipients of names were bad guys (of course, based on your own values) and that therefore we must “punish” them by eliminating those names is nonsensical. The past is the past and we cannot change history. Furthermore it would be utterly presumptuous to think that our values are the truth and that therefore we are entitled to judge other people and their political, religious or cultural habits and beliefs.3) As regards      your claim that naming species based on our cultural view is “antropocentric”,      this is another extremely questionable point. Honestly: do we have any      other point of view which is not ours (and therefore antropocentric)? The answer is obviusly not. We are      the only intelligent organisms on this planet and we are the only ones who      have created a complex language, which requires to have names for every      animal and plant. Are animals and plants intelligent enough to appreciate      or dislike names? Obviously not.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"18"},{"answer_post_date":"16th Mar, 2022","answer_content":"Not confusing others should be in the forefront of a taxonomist's mind when creating a new name.  If a taxonomist feels strongly that indigenous names matter, they can Latinize them and incorporate them into Linnean names.  Some organisms have multiple indigenous names from different tribes/languages, even different names in different villages of the same tribes/languages so is the right name the one the taxonomist first hears about?  As I stated previously, there are many other ways to honor a person's memory botanically.  I agree that naming taxa after people should be done sparingly, if at all, also that descriptive names are best if meaningful, yet not always particularly useful.  Naming an organism after yourself seems to invite trouble, especially if that taxonomist already leans towards heavy splitting.  Any time a new name is considered, it is critical to do thorough background work on related taxa including those from outside the geographical area of interest, and to study many, many specimens, especially of the target taxon.  Only humans have the ability to record speech.  However, there are other intelligent species.  Many birds are better than most humans at higher math and navigate by the stars without charts or instuments.  Many animals have higher levels of emotional intelligence than many humans.  Octopi appear to have high levels of intelligence though they are mollusks.  Dolphins, whales and elephants are increasingly being found to be intelligent.  Spiders can cooperate to hunt in packs.   Flies can process hundreds of visual images simultaneously from their faceted eyes, where human brains are limited to two.  There is much we don't know.

What we can, however, do is to lay bare what separates each field and determine if indeed policymakers find the former more useful than the latter.

On the other hand, history is a chronological study of events, issues, persons, groups to determine or explain why they happened or who did what and why they did what they did. In doing this, several perspectives are necessary to ascertain the veracity of the events and issues raised. In my opinion, both disciplines are relevant to policymakers. While political science/IR speak to power as the authoritative allocation of values, locally and globally, which is plainly the study and understanding of the power dynamics that shape policies and policymaking. On the other hand, history does avail us of the sources and trajectories of a particular policy and issues and challenges in their implementation over the years. In terms of methodology, political science/IR  has scientific metrics to measure the impact of public policy on society and even predict the policy behaviours based on these metrics.

Many factors are responsible for its creation and alleviation.  One factor that might often be overlooked is the government ownership of land.  Ninety percent of the land in Singapore is publicly-owned.  And eighty percent of the population live in public housing.In most places, public investments in quality infrastructure and increases in development permission (zoning) result in higher nearby land prices.  The ability of private landowners to appropriate this publicly-created land value is the fuel for land speculation.  Land speculation is a parasitic activity that creates nothing of value.  However, it does create an artificial scarcity of land available for development -- particularly at high-value prime sites (near high-quality infrastructure).  In many places, infrastructure is created to facilitate development.  But high nearby land prices chase development away from prime sites to cheaper, but more remote sites.  Governments extend infrastructure to these remote developments, only to have the cycle repeat, choking off development where infrastructure was improved and chasing it even further away.  This is a key dynamic explaining urban sprawl.  High land prices deprive businesses of the most productive locations.  And sprawl necessitates the wasteful duplication of infrastructure -- leading to higher taxes.  (Sprawl also has very negative impacts on the environment, energy consumption and climate change.)Thus, in many places, the ability of private landowners to appropriate land values (created by the public sector or collectively by private enterprise) impoverishes both capital and labor.  In Silicon Valley, California, where high-paying jobs are plentiful, housing prices are so high that couples making high salaries have difficulty finding decent and affordable housing.  (It's not because the bricks are more expensive there.  It's because land speculation inflates land prices.)  And, by reducing business profits, land speculation reduces employment.  Unemployment is a major cause of poverty.Singapore, through public ownership of land, has avoided the parasitic and wealth-draining consequences of land speculation.  In other communities, a similar result has been achieved by transforming the property tax into a public services access fee.  This is accomplished by reducing the tax rate applied to privately-created building values while increasing the tax rate applied to publicly-created land values.  The lower tax rate on buildings makes them cheaper to construct, improve and maintain.  (Good for residents and businesses alike.)  Surprisingly, the higher tax on land value helps keep land affordable by reducing the profits from land speculation.  Thus, without spending money or losing revenue, this \"tax shift\" can make both buildings and land more affordable.  As a bonus, this approach induces the development of high-value land.  This results in more development near existing infrastructure amenities and reduces urban sprawl.  This allows more people and businesses to be served by more compact (and less expensive) infrastructure networks.After WWII, both Japan and Taiwan increased taxes on land value and this was instrumental in helping these countries increase their productivity and their general standard of living.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"1st Oct, 2021","answer_content":"Apostaron por la educación.

Dragon assumes there is one user of their software.  So, is uncomfortable to switch accents.  Dragon is not free, but there is an educational price.  See the website.  Dragon has the advantage that you can teach it words, so if some words that are constantly in the audio that you need to transcribe are not in the Dragon corpus, you can add.  Dragon has an interface and ability to import mp3 (in the past, it did not import video, you will need to review the updates to the package to see if has changed).MICROSOFT:  Excellent with accents. Has improved beyond recognition compared to last year.  I believe that you can set up a student account with Microsoft to use their API.  This means, creating your own mini-interface to handle your data.  Microsoft has an online version, but the online free Microsoft often makes errors whereas the API version does not make those errors.

For a simple example, capturing proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, genomics for a uniform series of samples (could be from a cell line) before and after a common drug treatment with high multiplexing in dose and time for sample collection could enable quantitative description of how intracellular variables are related through time.Contrast this to the current approach, in which qualitative assessments have long-been the norm - i.e. \"Drug X eliminates Cancer cell A through UPREGULATION (qualitative) of Pathway Z\". These types of reports are far from quantitative and rarely describe the relationship between variables within the biological system mathematically. \"Drug X can be related to Pathway Z by  Equation 1 in Cancer cell A\" would be much more valuable as a finding. With time, this could then be integrated into a series of equations that capture the dynamic interactions of the entire cellular system.The shift towards these kinds of studies will definitely require perfected logistics and would reward us with developing computational models of cellular processes that better reflect real-world intra- and extra-cellular interactions. This sort of work has been done on the more simple organism (Mycoplasma Genitalium - https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(12)00776-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867412007763%3Fshowall%3Dtrue ). From my perspective, the bottleneck is no longer at the point of just technological development - we are now able to capture these snapshots holistically.

This is perhaps the drawback of modern education that despite universality of education or mass literacy, we are not able to achieve the goal of education i.e., enlightenment of one and enlightenment of all.

It is very good that so many different functions and roles of the education process have been mentioned that are particularly important beyond just transferring knowledge. In recent years, the significance of these additional functions may even have increased due to the increasing opportunities for students to acquire knowledge from the Internet. The development of ICT, Internet and Industry 4.0 information technologies increases the possibilities of independent, interactive acquisition of knowledge by pupils and students. Therefore, the role of the teacher as a pedagogue in shaping specific attitudes, directing skills development, e.g. in developing skills in creativity, entrepreneurship, innovation, critical thinking, etc. is growing. On the Research Gate discussion forum there are also questions about the possibility of implementing ICT information technologies , Internet and Industry 4.0 to educational processes and systems. The process of using ICT, Internet and Industry 4.0 information technologies in education is already underway and is likely to increase, but it should not lead to intelligent autonomous robots being able to replace humans someday in the future, because these machines will never have all the human characteristics in above all, they will not have emotional intelligence.

Hegel, “Truth in philosophy means that concepts and external reality corresponds”. So as long as philosophy is not exclusively preoccupied in knowing the \"shadow in cave's walls\"; its own mind (existentialism, the \"phenomenology of the mind, Psychology, Linguistic philosophy etc., as generally is the case with conventional philosophy) or the “Mind of God” as is the case with Kant’s subjective idealism and Einstein’s mathematical idealism; and instead, like Hegel seeks truth in external reality, it becomes a scientific enterprise!It so happens that philosophy in its conventional sense of the term comes to an end with Hegel’s dialectics! If the aim of all previous philosophy (like that of official theoretical physics) was to know the ultimate, absolute or the final truth (the theory of everything) of the world, Hegel’s dialectics (in spite of his \"Absolute Idea!) unambiguously showed that philosophy or physics can never hope to achieve that aim. As Frederick Engels explains, “Mankind therefore finds itself faced with a contradiction; on the one hand, it has to gain an exhaustive knowledge of the world system in all in its interrelations; and on the other hand, because of the nature both of man and of the world system, this task can never be completely fulfilled. But this contradiction lies not only in the nature of the two factors – the world, and man – it is also the main lever of all intellectual advance, and finds its solution continuously, day by day, in the endless progressive evolution of humanity just as for example mathematical problems find their solution in an infinite series or continued fractionations. Each mental image of the world system is and remains in actual fact limited, objectively through the historical stage and subjectively through the physical and mental constitution of its maker”. ( Frederick Engels, Anti-Dühring)So, “philosophy” in its materialist dialectical form is now a part of the positive sciences, helping to summarize, systematize and to guide the empirical sciences in search of positive knowledge with creative insights and intuition. And at the same time, only by embracing the dialectical method, will natural science “be able to rid itself on the one hand of any isolated natural philosophy standing apart from it, outside it and above it and on the other hand also of its own limited method of thought, which was its inheritance from English empiricism.” (F, Engels, Dialectics of Nature)","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"5"},{"answer_post_date":"26th Aug, 2021","answer_content":"H.G.

In developing the antinomies of pure reason, Kant showed that formal logic and causality always leads to contradictory conclusions and contradictions or to the mystery of a \"First Cause\". Hence, Kant posited, that formal logic and causality can never know reality, and therefore, in order to avoid contradictions our logic must limit itself to structuring and manipulating its subjective intuitions: its rational categories, and two types of a priori knowledge –analytic a priori and synthetic a priori. Kant warned philosophy to abate its claims of knowledge of the noumena, which is unknowable thing-in-itself, but only of the phenomena that objective reality presents to man's sense perceptions. Philosophy, Kant warned must give up all attempts to know reality, to penetrate behind the veil of appearances.It fell on Hegel to restore the honor of philosophy as the science of all sciences, the soul and the epitome of all knowledge, by pulling it out of its intractable problems and the lowest moment it reached by the time of Kant and in the process and as the irony of his dialectics, brought an end to philosophy itself, in its conventional meaning of the term! And strangest of all, this he accomplished by embracing the very same elements, namely the ideas of evolution and contradictions that all classical philosophers (Kant included) abhorred the most. On the contrary, Hegel put them at the very heart of his new philosophical system – the dialectical method. Hegel responded to Kant's philosophy by suggesting that the unsolvable contradictions given by Kant in his \"Antinomies of Pure Reason\" applied not only to the four areas Kant gave; but to any existence at all - in all objects, concepts, notions and ideas; as \"Being-Nothing\" - the first as well the last contradiction in an eternal cycle.Hegel unambiguously rejected the law of non-contradiction of theology, old idealism, rationalism and classical materialism (including natural science); the “excluded middle” of Aristotle and the thing-in-itself of Kant. For Hegel absolutely everything depends on “the Identity of identity and non-identity.” Opposites reside together at the very element of a thing or a process in simultaneous unity and opposition to each other and a resolution (\"Becoming\") of this logical contradiction (or inner conflict) provides the dynamics for change, motion, evolution, development etc. - the phenomenology of the Infinite, Eternal and Ever-Changing universe.

Since the ancient times philosopher have been interested in the subject of knowledge and questions related to it (questions like what is knowledge, that is how to define the concept of knowledge; how to gain knowledge or what methods we need and what can we use to acquire knowledge about something that interests us; how much can we know or what are the borders of knowledge, specifically that knowledge which is based on our experience of the world and so on).- In the context of knowledge, my opinion is that words \"philosopher\" and \"scientist\" are just names which mean nothing, names which are making unnecessary distinction for the one same thing - a human subject who wants to know something. The world is composed of individuals who are interested in different questions about many different phenomena, like mental phenomena - those which are inside us - and those phenomena which are external to us or outside us.- Third, both philosophy and science are dealing with subjects of knowledge, truth, certainty and many more depending on the context of research questions.- Philosophy and science share all of those characteristics. That is what I can tell you about philosophy and science from almost ten years of my experience. - In short, that is it; there is nothing more general(!!!) to be said about the these two disciplines.- If you want to understand more about how philosophy and science function and how are they related, you must read something from contemporary epistemology and philosophy of science.- Now, philosophy is more than thinking. She is more than a subject using his mind (or brain) to contemplate some questions, subjects, phenomena and so on.- Philosophy today, just like science, has a specific set of who knows how many subjects which philosophers are exploring, and there are some which I find important. Difference between philosophy and science is in subjects (but that difference is also not that big in some parts - for instance, philosophy of biology).- Philosophy today, just like science, has its own methods and rules which authors have to follow - this is what I claim.- To understand what I mean by method, it is best to read something from the subject of critical thinking. I have my own specific ideas about rules and methods in philosophy which I have developed over the years.- Not everything in philosophy can be correct, true, plausible, good idea and so on. Philosophers, just like scientists, can agree on many points, whether they are true or false, correct or incorrect...- Agreement is a consequence of following those rules. Many of those rules are not explicit and collected in one place - one book or a few - but experienced philosophers like me can definitely \"feel\" in their mind that there is \"something\" that is going on with the argument of another philosopher. Something objective, something that can apply to many ideas from different authors, some kind of pattern. That \"something\" must be expressed with words in a scientific paper in a form of an argument.- This is how I define philosophy: Philosophy is the science of claims and ideas (in the context of specific subjects). - Claims are nothing more than a material forms of ideas. The entire philosophy is about examining different ideas from different authors with the methods and rules that are different from those in science. - And the most important thing to know is that philosophers completely accept and agree with the main method of science - experimentation and knowledge through experience. This is something that many philosophers have been advocating through time and (I guess) all agree that truth of some claims - claims with specific empirical nature - must be based on that method.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"4th Oct, 2021","answer_content":"Dear readers,Just to add food for thought:In his What Does it Mean to Orient Oneself in Thinking?, Kant undertakes an analysis of the process of philosophical thinking.

I would even say that in moral/ethical terms to kill innocent people has to do with wrongness, not with rightness, or, as you say, righteousness. Problems arises when we look for criteria to define a moral or immoral actrion. Answers to this question vary acccording the worldview we espouses. For example, According to L. Kohlberg's justice  theory of moral stages and development,  moral actions are those that would pass, say, the test of reversibility (\"Would I advocate the same conclusion if positions in a situation of moral conflict and choice --  should/should we not steal to save a human life? Why/why not? -- were reversed ?), and the test of universalizability (\"Did I reach a conclusion that would be acceptable for all at all times and places?\".)  For Kohlberg, justice or not to treat others unfairly is the basic moral principle.According to C.  Gilligan's theory of moral development and an ethic of care and responsibility. benevolence is the basic moral principle.  According to this principle, we should not turn away from someone in need.According to J.

However, righteous behavior is associated with adhering to normative expectations or rules of a specific group.   But, it historically has roots in notions of right \"wisdom\".   Although a person can be righteous within that group or society, it does not mean that the behavior cannot be considered unjust by other moral precepts and others within the same righteous society.  In the middle ages, the Inquisition fostered a righteousness  that was subsequently recognized by historians as highly unjust.  Injustices occur when someone violates sacred values or behaviors considered the right behaviors for specific situations.   These sacred values can depart significantly from other rules promulgated by recognized authorities.  Sentiments of injustice are triggered when individuals violate what groups or societies consider appropriate behavior, right wisdom, or values. .A righteous person should do what is right, but what is right does not comport necessarily with what laws consider the legally right behavior.  Morality and law can differ.  Nonetheless, justice is a term in the west derived from what is considered the law  In this way, right behavior is equivalent to legal behavior.  But, as stated above, legal and rightful behavior are not always just.   This is why it is recognized in philosophy and law that morality is not the same thing as law.

It states that the concurrent precise measurements of position and momentum of a subatomic particle are not possible. This idea has been extended to another pair of quantities, time and energy, without proper justification. Therefore, there has been an endless debate on the validity of the uncertainty concept for the second pair, such as:· Can time be considered as an observable quantity? · Are these variables dynamically conjugate, both in classical and in quantum mechanics?· Does this pair exhibit similar principle as the position-momentum?· The mathematics of the uncertainty of energy-time pair is not well defined as standard deviation of time does not make sense.Furthermore, if a certain duration of time is necessary for the accurate measurement of some quantity like energy then we should consider it for momentum too. However, in the latter case, it has been accepted during the history of uncertainty principle, that the measurement of the momentum of any particle can be taken with an arbitrary accuracy irrespective of the duration of the measurement.If momentum should be treated like energy then it is better to separate Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle from the inevitable measurement inaccuracy of some physical quantities within short interval, which is well understood in science.

But phenomenological physics is replaced by the conceptual framework of quantum field theory. Just because of the evolution of a lot of concepts in theoretical physics. That’s why I propose that the aim of the discussion is to share light on the topic with the help of a recent conceptual framework.If we want to understand Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle and its relation with time and energy we have to realize that we try to understand a concept that has its causation at the lowest level of reality. The consequence is that we are forced to use only “bare” concepts (fundamental concepts). So we cannot mix two different concepts to facilitate e.g. a nice compact equation. Or to show an easy analogy with a known macroscopic “phenomenon”. In other words, position-momentum cannot be a “bare” concept so we cannot use this term if we want to fully understand Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, and its relation with energy and time. And there are more concepts in theoretical physics that aren't foundational at all but just hangovers from classic physics.If we use the conceptual framework of quantum field theory there must be some kind of a consensus about the general concept of QFT. Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is about the limited  accuracy of measurements that involve mass objects. But mass as a concentration of energy isn’t the  principal in QFT. The properties of the “back ground” quantum fields - existent everywhere in the universe - are responsible for the continuous transformation of observable reality so it is obvious that the universal structure of these quantum fields is in rest and it is the spatial structure that creates the motion and the other detectable properties of all the observable phenomena (and not the opposite).If you can agree with the \"statements\" above we can try to discuss the topic of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.With kind regards, Sydney","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"3rd Mar, 2021","answer_content":"Dear Sydney Ernest Grimm I initiated this discussion to find out about different opinions and approaches to the issue.

There are many legitimate readings of the energy-time uncertainty principle, but this is not one of them. Nowhere does QM license violation of energy conservation, and certainly no such authorisation entered into the derivation of Eq 3.151 (ΔE Δt≥ℏ/2)” ","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"3rd Mar, 2021","answer_content":"Dear Ziaedin Shafiei  and Mazen Khoder Suppose a point (I) in space. Without energy there is no observable change. But to observe a change there must be a change of position. Thus a certain amount of energy has caused a change of position of the conditions in I to point II. The transfer of the conditions in I to point II has a certain duration thus there is a distance (I → II), there is a duration (Δt) so there is a velocity (v) too.At the lowest level of reality energy is a fixed quantity, Planck’s constant (h). The linear velocity of the quantum of energy is a constant too, the speed of light (c). If we concentrate energy in 1 point in space we get mass (E = m c2). If we have a mass of 2h energy in 1 point of space, we cannot transfer the 2h mass with the speed of light. Because only a free quantum has the speed of light.But if we cannot transfer a multiple of Planck’s constant – concentrated in 1 point in space – with the speed of light we have to conclude that the quantum of energy is the universal quantum of transferable energy in 1 point of space. In other words, if we have 5 distinct points in space we can only transfer 5 quanta synchronously. And if we transfer 1 quantum from every point in the universe at exactly the same moment we get the law of conservation of energy.If we think about it we have to conclude that the described “mechanism” of quanta transfer isn’t possible if every quantum in the universe don’t have its own tiny spot of personal space, a kind of invariant volume. We have a name for it: the electric field. And the “tiny spots” represent the spatial structure of the electric field, directly related to the existence of Planck’s constant (h).If point I (see first sentences) and point II are adjacent points of the structure of the electric field the transfer of 1 quantum from point I to point II are determined by:Conclusion: the duration (Δt) must be a universal constant too.But if the speed of light, Planck’s constant and quantum time itself are universal constants, every local configuration that is build up by these constants – e.g. a particle – cannot “break up” these fixed universal quantities in smaller quantities. In other words, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is the consequence of the existence of the quantum of energy.I have tried to minimize the description.

But vacuum space is totally filled with quantum fluctuations (“wave-like changes” in the terminology of QM) and the energy that is necessary to create the quantum fluctuations is the energy of the field itself. Actually, the quantum fluctuations are the “observable” representations of the energy. Thus the dynamical part of the volume of our universe is the structure of the electric field. The magnetic field is a vector field and the vectors are created by the local amplitudes of the corresponding electric field, and visa versa. Vectors determine the direction of the next amplitudes but don’t transfer energy at all.Therefore we can use the concept of a single quantum of energy that changes its position. Thus the amplitude with the magnitude of 1 h is transferred by the electric field from point I to point II but both points have a joint face (surface area). Now we can exclude the possibility that the quantum that “arrives” in point II is not the quantum from point I. If I lengthen the distance between point I and point II nobody can prove that it is the same quantum that moved from I to II.  I have attached a schematic drawing of the transfer of 1 quantum from point I to point II. The structure of the electric field – “the points” – are the cubes (easy to draw) and the metric is the minimal length scale (lc ≈ 0,5 x 10-15 m). The transfer of the quantum (red) from point I to point II is a linear transfer. The velocity of the transfer is the speed of light (yellow arrow). Only point I and II are drawn grey. But at the moment that point I passes on 1 quantum to point II every point of the structure of the electric field in the whole universe will do the same. Thus for every point in space the transfer of 1 quantum to the points around means that there will be another incoming quantum that will \"fill the hole\" (law of conservation of energy).The consequence is that the duration of the transfer – actually it is a topological deformation within the structure of the electric field that passes on from I to II – is a constant. Thus quantum time is a constant (tc) and is the building block of Einstein's macroscopic relative \"time\". However, the image shows a linear transfer of a quantum (like an electromagnetic wave). If the transfer involves more than 2 opposite faces of a point the explanation isn’t simple any more.A particle is a local concentration of energy so it is “build up” by an amount of single quanta (E = m c2). The particle has a size that is larger than 1 unit (“point”) of the spatial structure of the electric field otherwise there exists no spin. Nevertheless the particle cannot change the minimal length scale or the fixed amount of the energy of 1 quantum (h) during its transfer within the structure of the electric field. Thus the minimal uncertainty of Heisenberg’s principle is 1 quantum (or if we focus on distance: 1 lc).In other words, your objections against the idea that we can “catch” or “borrow” energy out of nothing with the help of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is – in my opinion – 100% correct.With kind regards, Sydney","answer_image_url":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sydney-Grimm-2/post/What_is_the_exact_meaning_of_uncertainty_principle/attachment/6040e31157850000018c6057/AS%3A997602506055681%401614858380477/image/quantum.png","answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"4th Mar, 2021","answer_content":"Dear Mazen Khoder \"In the energy-time uncertainty principle is  not the standard deviation of a collection of time measurements; roughly  speaking it is the time it takes the system to change substantially.\" This quotation from Griffiths can apply to any variable such mometum or position.

I can provide a much simplified physical perspective to this \"principle\".Starting from two basic relations:   (1) Planck-Einstein E=hf for photon where E is energy, h is the Planck constant and f is the frequency of a photon. Because f=1/T where T is the period of the photon's oscillation, so E*T=h.(2) The de Broglie wave length momentum relation λ=h/p where λ is the matter wavelength,  h is the Planck constant and p is the momentum. So p*λ=h.Now you know E*T=p*λ =h from (1) and (2).  The so-called uncertainty comes in when E, T, p and λ are not completely well known or well measured. They each have their standard deviations around the expected values. If one varies around a fixed value, in order to make (1) and (2) hold, the other must also varies around a fixed value. The uncertainty principle just points out the fact that E and T are co-varying, p and λ are co-varying. If you do a mathematical deduction, you will arrive at the uncertainty principles that were established by the pioneers of quantum physics.To be specific, energy and time are a pair of quantities whose product of variations must vary around h (or other more accurate number),  momentum and position are a pair of quantities whose products of variations must vary around h (or other more accurate number).There are just so many ways to interpret uncertainty principles that involve possibly other physics observable quantities. But first of all, these observable quantities must be related, such as E*T=h or p*λ=h, otherwise they are not related to the uncertainty principles in (1) nad (2). For example, if two physics quantities A and B has the following relation A*B=1000h, then their uncertainty principle will be sqrt(<dA^2>)*sqrt(<dB^2>) on the order of 1000h. Time is a very interesting observable quantity, of course it can be physically observed - or in other words, compared with a time standard. It relate the duration from beginning to the end of a physical process to the number of oscillations of a standard atomic clock. But how to meaningfully define the beginning and the end of a physical process is another important decision point in order to apply the uncertainty principle properly.In my opinion, the uncertainty principle has been well misunderstood or misused. For example, the energy level of a hydrogen atom is very strictly fixed and conserved if it experiences no change of states. It doesn't depends on the time it stays at this energy level. The amount of energy cannot be more, cannot be less, unless something changes. It should have nothing to do with how long the atom has acquired the energy. So the energy won't vary with time, it is conserved. The uncertainty should be applied to statistical variations among multiple measurements of the same quantities, and the variation of time it takes to realize the measurements, not what it takes for the atom being held at that fixed amount of energy.

(1) As we all agree, E*T=h works for massless photon.  But it doesn't prevent massive objects from following the same rule. Physics should be simple, and a lot of things work the same way, massless or massive. Extension of principles from one physics process to another is a good way of physics development. If there is a difference, just figure out the difference and work on it.As mentioned previously, suppose A*B=1000h works for some massive objects, then the uncertainty rule will be around 1000h approximately. If the uncertainties proposed by quantum pioneers are correctly varying around h, then it indicates that these physics process do have rules similar to E*T=h.(2) The application of uncertainty principle is very tricky, and sometimes just full of issues. As you mentioned, T can be precisely measured,  then dT=0. If energy is precisely measured, then dE=0. Now the problem becomes bigger because the uncertainty principle is strictly broken in that dT*dE cannot be greater than h/4/pi any more. So there must be something missing in the thought process.In reality, there is no measurements can give exactly the same results, all measured quantities have uncertainties from various sources. Some of them, including the time and energy, are just varying up and down no matter how accurate they are.

It was also realised in the early days of QM that the Uncertainty principle when applied to a particle was equally well explained by treating the entities as waves. If an entity is spread out in space there will inevitably be some uncertainty in the position when measured. The wording of the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle specifically refers to particles.Data Prerecording of Conference Presentation on the Unification of Physics Now thinking about the uncertainty principle in connection with energy and time I think a relevant thought experiment is the one devised by Albert Einstein and presented to Niels Bohr. This thought experiment is referred to as Einstein's box:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr%E2%80%93Einstein_debates#Einstein.27s_second_criticismThe idea is that a box containing radiation has a shutter which opens to allow one photon to escape. The shutter operates at a precise time and the change in mass due to the escape of the photon can be known precisely. I think at the time Niels Bohr gave a \"not very good\" response and I don't really understand the solution given in Wikipedia which does derive the Energy Time inequality.My view on the Einstein box thought experiment is that, whereas it is true that the energy can in theory be measured accurately, the time that the shutter is open has to be sufficient for the photon wave quantum to escape and this is where the wave nature of entities comes into play and requires a minimum ∆t.So I agree with you that the position / momentum case is easier to visualise but I do think that the energy / time case is also explained just by thinking in terms of waves and not particles.Richard","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"15th May, 2021","answer_content":"Dear Richard Lewis I have a similar view.

It is known that the far field pattern of an aperture is the space Fourier transformation of the excitation in the aperture.

Under some simplifications about the production technology, growth in TFP becomes the portion of growth in output not explained by growth in traditionally measured inputs of labour and capital used in production. TFP is calculated by dividing output by the weighted average of labour and capital input, with the standard weighting of 0.7 for labour and 0.3 for capital. Total factor productivity is a measure of economic efficiency and accounts for part of the differences in cross-country per-capita income.[2] The rate of TFP growth is calculated by subtracting growth rates of labor and capital inputs from the growth rate of output.Total Factor Productivity (TFP) is often considered the primary contributor to GDP Growth Rate. While other contributing factors include labor inputs, human capital, and physical capital. Total factor productivity measures residual growth in total output of a firm, industry or national economy that cannot be explained by the accumulation of traditional inputs such as labor and capital. Since this cannot be measured directly the process of calculating derives TFP as the residual which accounts for effects on total output not caused by inputs.It has been shown that there is a historical correlation between TFP and energy conversion efficiency. Also, it has been found that integration (among firms for example) has a casual positive impact on total factor productivity.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"4"},{"answer_post_date":"6th Apr, 2020","answer_content":"Growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) depends on supply of resources such as labour, capital, natural resources.Many economists use production function approach to explain the importance of various factors for determining growth rate. The following type of production function has been used to measure the contributions of different factors to economic growth.Let Y = AF (L, K, N)where Y = Gross domestic product (GDP)A = Total factor productivityL = The quantity of labour inputK = The size of capital stockN = The quantity of natural resources.In the studies of sources of growth, the natural resources are taken as constant and human capital is added as a separate factor for determining growth in Gross Domestic Product. With these changes then the production function becomesY = AF (L,K,H)where H represents the quantity of human capital.An important way to assess the contribution of a resource to the production of goods and services is its productivity. By productivity we mean the ratio of output produced to the quantity of input used to produce it. We can measure productivity of a single factor such as labour or capital. To measure the productivity of all inputs together the concept of total factor productivity (TFP) is employed.The total factor productivity means the ratio of output produced to the amount of all inputs used. Total factor productivity is index of overall productivity of the economy. In fact, technical progress in the economy is measured by the annual increase in total factor productivity.Now, the economic growth depends on the increase in factor inputs and technological progress that is taking place in the economy. Improvement in technology makes factor inputs or resources more productive. If the quantity of resources is increasing and total factor productivity is rising, then output would grow faster than the increase in the quantity of resources.Therefore, rate of economic growth achieved will depend on the growth in resources (i.e. factor inputs such as labour, capital and the rate of increase in total factor productivity. ThusEconomic growth = growth rate of supply of resources + rate of increase in total factor productivityNow, the amount by which output increases due to the increase in labour input depends on the contribution of labour to it. Similarly, the amount by which output increases due to accumulation of capital depends on the contribution of capital to it.Assuming no change in natural resources and taking two factor production function, then the growth in real output resulting from the increases in labour and capital inputs can be obtained from multiplying the increases in labour and capital by their respective contributions to the production of output.Following the neoclassical economists such as Solow, and Meade the economists generally use the shares in national income (GDP) of labour and capital to measure their contributions to output. From the recent production function studies conducted for the US economy it has been found that labour’s share is about 70 per cent and capital’s share is about 30 per cent of national income. We can obtain the growth in output, (i.e. GDP) by using the following growth equation.% ∆GDP = % ∆TFP + 0.70 (% ∆L) + 0.30 (% ∆K)whereGDP = Gross Domestic Product∆TFP = Change in total factor productivity∆L = Increase in the quantity of labour∆K = Increase in the capital stockThe above growth equation shows how growth in GDP depends on changes in total factor productivity (TFP) and changes in quantities of factors such as labour and capital. Recall that change in total factor productivity measures technological progress that is taking place in the economy.Technical progress, that is, changes in total factor productivity is a crucial factor in determining growth of output. For example, if total factor productivity is increasing at the rate of 2 per cent per annum, then even with capital stock and labour force being held constant, gross domestic product (GDP) will increase at the rate of 2 per cent per annum.If labour input increases by 2 per cent and capital stock increases by 3 per cent per annum each, then applying the above growth equation:%∆GDP = 2 + 0.70 (2) + 0.30 (3)= 2 + 1.40 + 0.90 = 4.3Thus, GDP will grow at the rate of 4.3 per cent per annum.It is worth noting here that higher growth rate achieved by Japan in the past was not only due to rapid growth rate of capital stock but also because of relatively higher growth rate in total factor productivity (TFP), that is, technological progress.Further, from 1973 to mid nineties, lower growth rate in the United States has been due to slowdown in growth in total factor productivity. It may be further noted that differences in growth rates across countries can be explained in terms of differences in growth rates of capital stock and of total factor productivity.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"26th Apr, 2020","answer_content":"I would recommend reading Factory Physics by Hopp and Spearman.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"27th Apr, 2020","answer_content":"The productivity formula is simple: Productivity = Output / InputAnother way to look at it is: Productivity = Value of Work / Hours WorkedOutput can be measured in units, whereas value of work is typically measured in dollars.

This question page that started three years ago has attracted to date more than 14,300 reads. This fact alone proves how TFP attracts keen interest of economists. However, TFP became target of many severe criticisms for the lack of theoretical contents.TFP attracted wide interest when Solow (1957) showed that a substantial part of the American economic growth was explained by TFP, which Solow deemed a measure of technological change. Before that, Robinson (1953-54) started to criticize the concept of production functions and 1960’s there were a famous controversy often called capital theory controversy. Production function was criticized by Shaikh (1974) and Simon (1979), when the latter received Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences. At the turn to the 21st century, TFP was scrutinized by various economists of different strands: Prescott (1997), Hultan (2001), Lipsey and Carlaw (2001), and Felipe and McCombie (2007). Abramovitz (1993), reflecting his long study of economic growth as historian, concluded that TFP shows our degree of ignorance. Subsequent to Felipe and McCombie (2003)  and many other papers, the two published Felipe and McCombie (2013) that contains in its title a phrase from Wolfrang Pauli’s expression “Not even wrong”. It means that TFP and aggregate production function have no theoretical meanings and it is impossible to refute propositions that contain them.I have given a quick look over the comments until now and find there are few critical comments. It reminded me a famous expression by Tjalling Koopmans (1947). I wonder whether people use TFP only because it gives measurement and talk about growth even if they cannot understand what it really means.[References]Abramovitz, Moses 1993 The Search for the Sources of Growth: Areas of Ignorance, Old and New.

Under some simplifications about the production technology, growth in TFP becomes the portion of growth in output not explained by growth in traditionally measured inputs of labour and capital used in production. TFP is calculated by dividing output by the weighted average of labour and capital input, with the standard weighting of 0.7 for labour and 0.3 for capital. Total factor productivity is a measure of economic efficiency and accounts for part of the differences in cross-country per-capita income.[2] The rate of TFP growth is calculated by subtracting growth rates of labor and capital inputs from the growth rate of output.Total Factor Productivity (TFP) is often considered the primary contributor to GDP Growth Rate. While other contributing factors include labor inputs, human capital, and physical capital. Total factor productivity measures residual growth in total output of a firm, industry or national economy that cannot be explained by the accumulation of traditional inputs such as labor and capital. Since this cannot be measured directly the process of calculating derives TFP as the residual which accounts for effects on total output not caused by inputs.It has been shown that there is a historical correlation between TFP and energy conversion efficiency. Also, it has been found that integration (among firms for example) has a casual positive impact on total factor productivity.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"4"},{"answer_post_date":"29th Nov, 2021","answer_content":"Great","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"2"},{"count":18}]],[{"question_post_date":"24th Jan, 2022","question_title":"What is the formula used by the Philippine Social Science Council used for the number of respondents in a random sampling?","question_image_url":null,"question_content":"What is the formula used by the Philippine Social Science Council used for the number of respondents in a random sampling and the applicable margin of error to be used the fact that I need a small number of respondents that must still be reliable for a study?","question_tags":["Philippines","Random Sampling","Social Science"]},[{"answer_post_date":"26th Jan, 2022","answer_content":"It is impossible to help you without acknowledging your research question, problem, and domain.

Why might time be the most important technical challenge? maybe because it holds it all together, in the real and in the virtual, like the conductor of a symphony.  To share an example, Husserl distinguishes three levels of time, 1st is objective time, the 2nd subjective time, and the 3rd the consciousness of internal time. Objective time can be measured by clocks and science and we are receiving this within our subjective time, so they both operate in awareness of each other. Internal time consciousness provides a consciousness of succession which apprehends successive mental states, this is correlated with subjective time by the unity across successive mental states.  For example, my written answer in this Research Gate conversation is a 5 minute long read, we can agree on this being the objective time, some of you experience reading my written answer as being slow and feeling like its 10 minutes or  you might perceive it being fast as 2 minutes, this is subjective time, and the recognition of both the objective and subjective time comes from our consciousness of internal time. This structure of time, Husserl's temporality, is of interest to us as a structure we can bring into the design of the temporal landscape of virtual reality. The image above might offer a visual example of Husserl’s concept and the beginnings of understanding time as a design quality in virtual reality. The bright central light in the image above can be thought as objective time, the lines leading out of it in the middle region, subjective time, and the ring of lines on the outer ring as the consciousness of internal time.This example of Husserl's temporality, the image above, the understanding of these 3 levels of time, is a route for us to explore, our question is then how do we incorporate 3 levels of time in virtual reality? incorporating in a technical sense the design of time perceived in virtual reality. How does it happen, by slowing movement of graphics at a distance? depth perception as Mr. Payam Tabriziandoes shared? how does the most proximate surroundings in the virtual regulate our sense of time? how does sound affect our perception of time? so many questions, i hope i moved the conversation forward, a little. Answering this question might determine the acceptability and success of this medium in society, it is a big question we are asking today, because time perceived even determines your exhaustion, mental and physical, when using virtual reality, not to mention whether you are a return user.

It is very difficult to select the explants that the different explant tissues from the same mother plant produced embryogenic callus at different frequencies and required different concentration of growth regulators for the induction of somatic embryos. So, the type and age of explants has an impact on somatic embryogenesis. Generally young, dividing, and possibly less differentiated cells are preferred for embryogenic pathway than older cells. Apart from explant nature, its genotype plays an important role in determining somatic embryogenic competence. Furthermore, media modifications such as manipulations of the concentrations of inorganic salts and vitamins can have a significant effect on somatic embryogenesis possibly through altering the osmotic potential of the medium.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"count":16}]],[{"question_post_date":"27th Feb, 2022","question_title":"What is the neural network training behind tensorflow lattice model?","question_image_url":null,"question_content":"I didn't understand the exact working algorithm of the TensorFlow lattice layer.

For example in the case of homelessness (an extreme form of poverty) there are three causal factors discussed, which can cause a greater vulnerability to become homeless (as a form of poverty):1. Social factors (like housing shortage, general unemployment or social climate),2. Individual factors (few qualifications, accumulated and chronic diseases, poor abilities to manage conflicts or to manage regulatory affairs, poor abilities to build a new circle of friends,3. Triggering situations (death of a spouse/related persons, unemployment, divorce, unexpected accident, illness or handicap and natural disasters)So the causal factors can only describe the risk / vulnerability to becomehomeless, but there are many people, suffering from illnesses, natural disasters, divorce or comparable circumstances and they don't become homeless.In the same way, you can extract factors for your topic \"poverty\", which describe a greater vulnerability for becoming poor, compared to the total population.Good luck and kind regardsDetlefhttp://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0,,contentMDK:20238993~menuPK:492141~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:430367,00.html","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"2"},{"answer_post_date":"","answer_content":"People living under vulnerability are those how are classified between the poor people and the median class.In developing countries, gender is one of the most significant determinants of poverty.

Typically, if  there are first order time derivatives in the equations of motion, there are other terms, like cross products, that are odd under reflection, so it's interesting to see whether it is possible to combine time reversal with another discrete symmetry, or not.

How do you understand life if it is really a great suspense? Why are we here? First of all, I consider that our life is a gift from God!\nI perceive that Life is to give you a meaning, an intelligent meaning so that you are aware that you are, that you perform, that you move and that you exist, so that you are aware of your real location on this planet Earth and by derivation, in the Universe in general. But above all, LIFE is a \"PATH\" by which you travel in your day to day, it is a path that is there for whatever you want it to serve, contributing your skills to travel it. Among other species that also walk their WAY, we define ourselves as an integral part of the human species, with its necessary and original process to achieve its conservation. The \"body-mind\" is born, grows, develops, evolves, responds to stimuli, etc., but the most \"responsible\" and decisive thing about this miracle is that you can serve yourself, you can help safeguard other species , you can serve to safeguard your Planet, you can simply serve others, or you can believe that Life itself is useless and decide to live as a ghost for as long as YOUR LIFE lasts, without Life itself having a \"clear objective\" to be lived. And it is that Life does not have a meaning in itself, more than the meaning that you want to give it. Therefore, there is no true answer to this Question, the answer is within you, \"within your own SOUL.\" If we internalize ourselves and manage to \"transcend in SOUL and consciousness\" giving meaning and direction to both, we can achieve the total liberation of our person as \"subject of Life\" and walk well on the GOOD PATH of our own and only LIFE.My respects","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"19"},{"answer_post_date":"16th Aug, 2021","answer_content":"“May you live every day of your life.”― Jonathan Swift","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"2"},{"answer_post_date":"16th Aug, 2021","answer_content":"To God's command, oh muse, be tractable,Not fearing the offense, not demanding a crown,Receiving both the praise and slander calmly,And do not arguing with the fool.A.S.

I am not in favour to comapre the great people of any branch, because they are all great in their own perspectives. Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe are contemporary and Marlowe is far more educated (University wits) than Shakespeare, yet the world knows Hamlet, Macbeth, Romeo and Juiiet, but very few people know Tamburlaine the Great; Dido, Queen of Carthage; Edward II; The Massacre at Paris; and The Jew of Malta, why? Becuse shakespeare could relate to the contemporary people more closely than Marlowe.  Marlowe's genius and highly congnitive mind prevented him to produce literature for common people.William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe were both writers of the Elizabethan stage, living in the same town of London, at the same time, and they wrote plays while working with the same people.  Their strongest similarity was in their work.  They both had an innate ability to write about love, great tragedies, comedies, drama and poetry with a similar style called blank verse.  Before Marlowe’s time, blank verse was not an accepted verse for drama, but he was able to substitute the regular stresses of earlier blank verses and created a more departed, sincere verse.  Shakespeare later followed Marlowe’s example and was able to master the ordinary rhythm of this new style of…show more content…\nOn the other hand Shakespeare was self-schooled after the age of 15, showed little interest in current ideals or philosophic ideas. Shakespeare used his personal observation and experiences to understand human nature. He had amore objective view of reality than Marlowe did. When we compare some of Marlowe’s tragedies with those of Shakespeare’s we discover several more similarities. Both Marlowe and Shakespeare create their hero’s as tragic heroes with some sort of flaw in their character that eventually causes their demise, a demise that would cause feelings of pity for the hero. One difference in the two writers is that Shakespeare liked to use the supernatural to enhance the sense of mystery, for example the witches in Macbeth or the ghost in Hamlet. Where as Marlowe’s tragedies had no such mystery and one could follow the course of the events and foresee the tragic doom without much difficulty. The two writers also differed when it came to some of their development of characters. Shakespeare was far superior to Marlowe in the developing the internal and spiritual conflict in the minds of his heroes.  Shakespeare’s Hamlet and Macbeth for example are far more well rounded individuals than those in Marlowe’s writings. Also it should be noted that Shakespeare was able to supply a lot of secondary characters in his tragedies like Horatio or Kent, as well as several female characters like Cleopatra, Desdemona, Lady Macbeth and others. Shakespeare explored vareid direction of human nature, revenge and love.  He was less interested in didactic writing and he was successful in digging the conflicts of his heroes which the spectator could feel with empathy.  Marlow was rather conservative and his Dr. Faustus or Tumberlaine all had fallen and fallen for their own folly. Shakesprear's characters rather modern in nature and their folly is of decision and Hamartia. Speciality of Shakespreare which is the  fundamental quality of him , I think, is common subject choice. Shakespreare was genius but Marlowe was erudite. One thing I would also to add that Shakespeare wrote under professional point of view, to earn his bread and butter, and Marlowe had no such demand.

William Shakespeare is no exception, and speculation continually follows the playwright, especially since we know so little about him. Only a few certain facts are known, and even fewer documents survive regarding Shakespeare. But Shakespeare isn’t the only playwright during his time period to be surrounded by speculation. His contemporary, Christopher Marlowe, is a victim of the same circumstances. Rumors about Marlowe range from espionage to collaboration. Who exactly was Marlowe and what connections does he have to Shakespeare? Join us as we take a closer look into both of these mysterious playwrights.\n\nAccording to Bill Bryson’s biography Shakespeare: The Illustrated and Updated Edition, we cannot be exactly certain when Shakespeare arrived in London, but we do know that Marlowe was an upcoming playwright in the 1590s, especially after Tamburlaine the Great. Unfortunately, Marlowe also had a short temper, and in September 1589, he became involved in a fight with innkeeper William Bradley. Playwright friend Thomas Watson stepped in and killed Bradley in a duel. Both Marlowe and Watson ended up in prison, and this wasn’t the only time Marlowe ran into trouble with the law. In 1593, anti-immigration notices featured lines from popular dramas, including Marlowe’s Tamburlaine the Great, to dissuade people from seeing these shows.Marlowe was also accused by author Thomas Kyd of being an atheist, which led to questioning before the Privy Council. After all this, Marlowe still argued over a bill at a bar and began stabbing another bar patron who in self-defense turned the knife on Marlowe and killed him. He was only twenty-nine years old.\n\nAt this point in time, Shakespeare was gaining a great deal of recognition for his poetry and had the patronage of an aristocrat, but he decided to return to theatre by writing comedies including Love’s Labour’s Lost, The Two Gentlemen of Verona, and The Comedy of Errors. Marlowe, however, had focused on ambitious dramas including The Jew of Malta and The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus. Marlowe’s death has left historians and literary scholars wondering what would have happened if he had lived.📷William ShakespeareSome believe Marlowe was assassinated by a request from the Crown. Others think that Marlowe’s death was faked, and that he is the real author of Shakespeare’s plays. The theory behind this is that Marlowe faked his death, escaped, and hid so he could continue to work under the patronage of Thomas Walsingham.During Shakespeare and Marlowe’s time in London, the theatrical scene was incredibly busy with intense demands on playwrights and actors. Shakespeare in Love which is enjoying a regional premiere at the Festival this summer, develops the possibility of collaboration between the two playwrights, which was common as playwrights struggled to keep up with the pace of theatrical productions. The play suggests a relationship between Shakespeare and Marlowe as Marlowe mentors the new playwright while he woos Viola and writes his masterpiece Romeo and Juliet.\n\nPutting Shakespeare in Love, is this story of Marlowe true? Was Marlowe’s death faked so he could continue to write the literary masterpieces we attribute to Shakespeare? Bryson indicates that the man behind this theory, Calvin Hoffman, opened Thomas Walsingham’s tomb to uncover manuscripts and letters to prove his case. He found no materials, however, but still made this case in The Murder of the Man Who Was ‘Shakespeare.’Whether or not the accusations are true, one thing is certain: Whomever [sic*] wrote Shakespeare’s work, whether it was the playwright or not, the elaborate words, plotlines, and characters continue to resonate with audiences, directors, and actors worldwide. Both the compilation of plays from Shakespeare and Marlowe will always be integrated in our lives and our world as we continue to study, perform, and experience them.\"*To be grammatically correct, the subject of this sentence should be \"Whoever\".

I must say at the start, however, that I am pretty skeptical of extended, counter-factual history.

I notice, however, that the counter-factual question is employed above in the interest of various topics related to the cultural differences between the North and South, etc. It is not my intention to deny the interest of such further tangential questions.Historically, I would say that the tendency toward ethnic nationalism has always been stronger in the American South. (BTW: It is often remarked that the U.S. Army \"speaks southern.\") This will sometimes go unnoticed, because of the diverse European influxes to the South early on--English, Scots, Irish, German chiefly. But basically the various European sources managed to combine themselves into the \"white\" South, excluding the slaves and later drawing strict lines of segregation after the Civil War. The later immigration to the U.S. tended to avoid the deep South. No one wanted to compete against slave labor, earlier on, and later the system of segregation was also an impediment to larger-scale immigration. In consequence, the North is historically more diverse in the background sources of the population. Northern society is dominated, more or less (again traditionally) by the pervasive efforts to integrate the diversity. \"E pluribus unum,\" as we say. I regard this as a great cultural accomplishment.In contrast, I would say that the recent \"multiculturalism\" from the 1990's on is more akin to southern patterns of separation and distinct development, \"separate but equal\" as the old segregationist slogan had it before the desegregation of the American public schools. (At one time, during the Clinton administration, all the major federal offices where held by southerners. Recall that President Clinton himself came from Arkansas.)

The American founders were in several ways a quite idealistic lot, and the last thing they wanted to happen was to replicate the European wars of the 17th and 18th centuries on the North American continent. I have a very nice quotation to this effect from the historian Gordon Wood.One way to look at the period of the 18th-century American crisis, is that we first combined with the British to throw out the French, in the French and Indian War (the Seven Years' War), and afterward, we combined with the French to throw out the British.On the back of every dollar bill, in a semi-circle under the pyramid (the back of the \"great seal\") it reads \"Novus Ordo Seclorum\"  --\"the new order of the ages.\" The hope was that the republican and federalist ideals of the early American founding would spread. The \"comity of the states\" was a central objective. It has effectively meant hundreds of years of relative peace on the North American continent. To substantiate your claim of \"farfetched propaganda,\" I think you might have to examine the Federalist Papers or the related claims and objectives stated there.

What I regard as more useful is in-depth study of particular episodes of history as a possible repeating (better: near-repeating) pattern of human behavior. That can be useful; and some of what appears in this thread might be regarded in somewhat this way. Let me also take brief issue with you regarding a comment you made a page or two back in reply to someone else. You wrote:There is all too often a view expressed that self-willed resilience and independence are in all cases virtues. Similarly that the 'little man' is always oppressed and that their views are ignored. This is not the politics of success and co-operation it is the disease of resentment, hate, xenophobia and ignorance.---End quotationWhile I generally agreed with your comments in that note, and I found it an interesting contribution, what you say in the quoted passage strikes me as simply an unsupported over-generalization. Its too broadly phrased to invoke very broad agreement or acceptance. This is not to deny that \"resentment, hate, xenophobia and ignorance,\" are not sometimes deep and genuine problems. But it strikes me as excessive to tar \"self-willed resilience and independence\" or the aim for political protection of the interests of ordinary citizen with these words generally.Whether something like \"self-willed resilience and independence\" may be a justified response seems to depend on what a person may be up against. For some, unfortunately \"cooperation\" simply means going along to get along, no matter the price--the proverbial \"deal with the devil.\" The supposed \"politics of success and cooperation\" on the other hand, may be a thin disguise for unprincipled acquiescence in things that simply should not be tolerated--as in our recent discussion of the failures of the policy of \"tolerance of intolerance.\"If we believe in \"government by the consent of the governed,\" then this means the citizens generally, and this is going to include the less educated, the under-educated and the unenlightened as well. People generally deserve a chance in life. Lack of suitable representation may amount to a neglect of the needed articulation and recognition of the interests of particular segments of the population, even the lack of desire to articulate their interests--since, as may often be the case, articulation of opposing interests may be politically more profitable.Great outbreaks of populist protests, such as we are witnessing generally, especially where they do not command educated agreement, are an appropriate point to consider which interests and points of view have been neglected and have gone without appropriate representation. Because of that it is a mistake to simply reject and denigrate the entire phenomenon in terms appropriate to its least appealing expression.It seems to me, e.g., that the British Labour party is rightly giving some serious reconsideration to the Blair policies and the former platform of \"New Labour,\" and likewise, it is fully appropriate for the next Democratic party nominee in the U.S. to devote some serious questioning and re-thinking on themes such as growing inequalities, \"identity politics,\" \"multiculturalism,\" militarization of American society and neo-liberal globalization.   H.G.

That is part of the original rationale of the 2nd amendment. Though the British forces could occupy and control the cities for extended periods, if they marched out into the countryside, the small farmers, fearing loss of their land to aristocratic invaders, would rise up in arms, and often the American army had to run to keep ahead of the farmers. This was a consistent pattern in the North, during the Revolutionary War, and the Jeffersonian Republicans in particular sought to populate the West (particularly the old Northwest territory, East of the Mississippi and North of the Ohio) with small farmers for this reason. If you fly over the area, to this day you will see the great square blocks of land which were demarcated for this purpose. Many in Philadelphia were skeptical of the Civil War at the time, and there were very important business interests running North and South. Quaker Philadelphia, as you'd expect, given their pacifism, was not enthusiastic. But when the southern armies invaded Pennsylvania, a Philadelphia General (Meade) was sent out to meet and defeat them at Gettysburg. The invasion increased Northern support for the war effort.  Jefferson himself had regarded Virginia as \"his country,\" and the importance of local and state loyalty was much more important in the early republic. Such thinking may have entered into inhibition of Confederate invasion plans.Toward the end of the Revolutionary War, the British changed their strategy and invaded the South. With a few important exceptions, given the slave system, they did not there encounter the same popular armed resistance in the countryside. In consequence the aid of French troops and the French navy was crucial to the final victory over the British at Yorktown.

You wrote:Because Napoleon III helped the South from Mexico where he had troops, the winning North encouraged Bismarck to enter into a war against Napoleon III and helped Prussia with new automatic guns, more efficient than french ones.---End quotationI wonder if you can give us some sources for this claim. It sounds interesting. Still, the Franco-Prussian war took place some 5-6 years after the end of the American Civil war, and by that time, as I recall, the U.S. Army had been built down from millions to a mere 30,000 men--at which level it stayed for the next 30 years. This was substantially a return to the \"fear of standing armies\" prevalent among the American founders.After Napoleon III was released from captivity by the Prussians (he had been captured at Sedan), he went and lived in England where he was well treated; and he was even visited by Queen Victoria. This suggests that the British were not all that favorable to the Prussian cause at the time. Since the French had left Mexico at the end of the American Civil War, it is not clear to me what might have motivated an American intervention in European affairs at the time of the Franco-Prussian war --such as you claim.

This greatly weakened the regime of Emperor Maximilian. He had been, in part, called in by Mexican monarchists, but didn't accept the call until after the French invasion of Mexico. During the entire time of his reign, his government was under great pressure from Mexican liberals and republicans who refused to recognize his rule. They ended up in a very bitter fight with many executions on both sides.What the American government did, by way of aid to the Mexican republicans, was to \"allow weapons to get lost\" from American posts on the Texas border; and in this way the Americans aided the revolt which eventually overthrew Maximilian. I found no indication that Maximilian's government did anything to aid the CSA. Napoleon III might have wanted to foster such indirect aid to the Confederacy, but he wouldn't do so openly given that the British were not so inclined. Maximilian did resist French advice at times. It is hard to see how any American weapons could have got from the Mexican rebels to the Prussians; and it is somewhat implausible that the Prussians would have needed support from Mexico in their fight against the French second Empire. Of course the lack of evidence is not evidence to the contrary, but I am left without any reason to believe that U.S. guns were sent to Prussia during the Franco-Prussian war.It was clear from my readings that President U.S. Grant did not hold a high opinion of Napoleon III. He expected the Prussians to win once the war broke out. He sent a special envoy to Europe to observe what was going on, and this fellow decided to observe from the Prussian side. However, the American Minister in Paris at the time remained at his post through the war and through the siege of Paris. He acted to protect citizens of the North German confederation who were present in France during the war, and facilitated communication between the French and the Prussians.

Jones's account of German immigration to the Americas and notice the interesting patterns of distribution in each wave of immigration. Jones talks of the arrival of Germans in the late 17th century, principally to Pennsylvania, upstate NY, Georgia and North Carolina.  This population in the South would of course have provided a German element to the Confederate forces but they would by then of course have been several generations removed from their German and German Swiss Canton forebears.The 17th century German immigrants had been largely displaced by the wars of Louis XIV particularly in the Rheinland Palatinate.  Most of these immigrants were not of sects such as Mennonites or Amish but were Lutheran or Calvinist Protestants.According to Jones the wave of German immigrants arriving in the mid 19th century were not refugees from the German revolutions of 1848 but rather what we today call 'economic migrants'.  They were in the main from Württemberg, Baden or Bavaria and had left due to the economic consolidation of farms leading to small farmers being squeezed out of the market. Many of this wave of German migration settled in Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota and Iowa, predominantly in what would become the Union states.One very interesting observation is of Bellville, Illinois in 1850.  The town had a German mayor, a German majority of the town council, three German language newspapers and even the local black population spoke German.If Jones is providing us with an accurate account then it would appear that the Germans who took part on either side in the Civil War were actually ‘different’ Germans originating in different parts of Germany and with different histories.   ","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"16th Aug, 2016","answer_content":"The skull and crossbones is a universal symbol not only of death but of loyalty.  One of the most famous cavalry regiments of the British Army the 17th Lancers wore it as a cap badge (see below).  The regiment saw extensive service in the American Revolutionary War and it was one of its members who informed George Washington of the cessation of hostilities.Another famous unit who wore this badge was the Prussian Deaths Head Hussars.  The badge symbolises loyalty until death or death before dishonour.It was worn also by the Nazi SS as a cap badge (totenkopf) and by some members of the Wehrmacht panzer troops on their collar patches.    ","answer_image_url":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Barry-Turner-2/post/What_would_have_happened_if_the_Confederacy_won_the_civil_war/attachment/59d6380179197b807799544b/AS%3A395639646113793%401471339250842/image/thR22KGBJB.jpg","answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"16th Aug, 2016","answer_content":"The origin of the cap badge is traced to a Colonel Hale (the regiment was also known as Hale's Light Horse) and it is said it was a memento mori of General Wolfe who was killed storming the Heights of Abraham in Quebec during the Seven Years War.  The Lancers Skull and Crossbones bears the motto \"Or Glory\"An earlier manifestation of it was seen during the English Civil War on a flag which had a picture of both a skull and crossbones and a laurel wreath with the motto \"One of These\".

Unlike in the case of Creative thinking, Critical thinking adopts a much more rigid position. One of the features of Critical thinking is that it is not so expansive like creative thinking. In fact, it can be said that critical thinking is judgmental in nature. It is interesting to note that critical thinking is selective too. On the other hand, creative thinking is not selective. It is quite free by nature. The mind is free to think anything creative in the case of creative thinking. On the contrary, the mind is limited to think in the case of critical thinking. Creative thinking is employed in areas such as poetry, novel writing, short story writing and fiction writing. On the other hand, critical thinking is employed in organizations, business areas and the like. Critical thinking is aimed at improving the quality of products produced by a company, customer care service, and the like. It analyses the factors governing the process of running a company.

He would be analytical and break down a particular concept into various parts and analyze them. This includes paying attention to the plus and minus, the pros and cons, when thinking critically.

If a person is continuously paying attention to the limitations and boundaries, it is quite difficult to be creative. Creative thinking is non-judgmental and expansive. There is no end to creative thinking. In fact, it can be said that the sky is the limit for creative thinking. This is the specialty of Creative thinking. It allows the person to break away from the usual barriers and imagine the unimaginable. Also, Creative thinking is not selective.

For one thing, there should never have been any departments in such subjects; rather, special programs jointly administered by rigorous fields such as anthropology, biology (including evolutionary), sociology and history. It was obvious back then that independent women's-studies departments would just be taken over by zealots, not objective scientists or scholars.

Even people living with disabilities now have voice to demand for inclusion in governance processes like enabling voting environment and their association's inclusion in election observation in Nigeria, which the National Electoral body considered and adopted.Therefore, empowering women and vulnerable groups would add value in human capital and social capital development in nation-building, national cohesion, development and growth.

Because the human development of civilization is the main source of the progressing and probably accelerating global warming process, the man should reform processes of development of the energy sector and other industries so as to significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and various aspects of environmental pollution in the coming years.Because it is not easy to introduce such taxes due to the strong lobbying of large corporations, it may be a better solution to introduce regulations that require enterprises to switch to renewable energy sources and use biodegradable raw materials instead of, for example, very slowly degradable plastics. The development of this type of solutions could be activated also through the system of specific tax concessions or subsidies for investment expenditures from the state budget fudnsh. In this way, pro-environmental state interventionism would be developed. This type of process has already begun in the European Union. For example, at the end of 2018, regulations were introduced banning the use of plastic in the packaging of various products within the European Union and as cutlery in restaurants from 2022. However, this is just the beginning of the process, which should be developed on a much larger scale within the framework of pro-environmental state intervention.Do you agree with my opinion on this matter?In view of the above, I am asking you the following question:What are the main determinants of the implementation of pro-environmental state intervention?Please replyI invite you to the discussionThank you very muchBest wishes","question_tags":["Ecology","Eco-Innovation","Crisis Intervention","Policy","sustainable growth","Green Building","Green Economics","Green Energy"]},[{"answer_post_date":"14th May, 2019","answer_content":"In addition to what you've truly mentioned, I'd like to highlight the necessity of global collaborations and especially paying attention to poorest developing countries in various dimensions of sustainable innovations and development.

AbstractThe activation of norm perception can promote pro-environmental behavior. How does media, as important variables in activating norm perception, affect pro-environmental behavior? Through an online survey of 550 randomly selected Chinese citizens, this study examines the roles of traditional media and social media in influencing the relationship between norm perception and pro-environmental behavior. Based on multi-level regression analysis of data, this study found that (1) compared with traditional media, social media play a more significant role in moderating the relationship between norm perception and pro-environmental behavior; (2) the promotion of the perception of injunctive norms by traditional media has a negative relationship with pro-environmental behaviors; (3) the activation of subjective norm perception by social media will promote pro-environmental behaviors. According to this research, in the current media environment, we should carefully release pro-environmental information on social media and encourage relevant discussions, and appropriately reduce environment-relevant injunctive normative information on traditional media.

In recent years, due to the accelerating changes in climate, the process of global warming is growing in importance of pro-environmental state intervention. How the pro-environmental state interventionism should be properly implemented has already been researched and demonstrated. I am doing research on this and the results of this research have been described in the published articles that I have posted on my profile of this Research Gate portal. However, the results of these studies are still ignored by decision-makers planning, shaping and implementing national environmental policy. In a country where the process of pro-environmental transformation of the economy operates, instead of being conducted fairly, it is slowed down and limited. Still most of the electricity is technologically obsolete, government-controlled and monopolistic large companies in the energy sector by burning fossil fuels. Investments in renewable energy sources are limited despite large revenues from speculative trading of CO2 emission rights. This is one of the key drivers of rising energy prices. In view of the above, despite the existing for at least several years the possibilities of increasing the scale of pro-environmental state interventionism, these opportunities were not only not used, but also deliberately the processes of the pro-environmental transformation of the mining and energy sector were and are still being limited and slowed down.

Sometimes even skilled maintenance mechanics don't get it right the first time because troubleshooting is a trial and error task, but aircraft that have integrated fault reporting are making it easier.  Avionics test stations cost several million or more, but they speed up the process if they are available within the immediate organization.  The component is removed from the aircraft and sent to the back-shop where the black box is hooked up to the station and the stimulus and measurement software program is run to find erroneous values from the box.  There are avionics components that flag themselves.  There are also bus controllers that will say which avionics component on their bus has failed.  Sometimes you don't have a highly integrated system or the luxury of a test station or its not a black box issue and you have to get into the diagrams but management can pressure you to \"fix it now!\" (definitely not my current employer).  If a repair facility is used, a part must be rented or cannibalized in the interim.  We expect the new part will fix the issue, but often it doesn't.  Sometimes there are factors which contribute to not being able to perform the troubleshooting as written in the fault isolation manual.  Other maintenance being performed can inhibit the process.  You can't open the engine compartment because someone is working up on the pylon.  A single wire can travel the entire length of the aircraft.  Poor manufacturing can cause electrical wear issues that must be mitigated on the flight line.  Extreme safety protocols like writing a ton of overlapping warning tags and forms discrepancies and having quality assurance stand over you and make sure every \"i\" is dotted and every \"t\" is crossed (a previous employer) is definitely an inhibitor to technicians to want to do the full fault tree.  Instead, they read through each step and try to figure out from the fault tree what the problem is by the process of elimination \"we know its not that, so it must be this.\"  Not having the complete diagrams can be an inhibitor.  I worked in a back-shop where they sent me all of the flight control avionics components from the aircraft.  I looked in the diagram of inside the flight control panel which they did not have access to and was able to determine they were missing a weight-on-wheels signal.  It turned out I was correct and didn't have to spend two entire shifts testing the components.  Aircraft are highly complex beasts - one particular aircraft I worked had around 50 avionics components, literally hundreds of relays, and a thousand circuit breakers.    There was actually a published list of \"nuisance faults\" because the system was so integrated.  Having full documentation is important - every technician needs a theory of operation or function for a system or component to have an understanding of how it works, a job guide or manual for performing the work they can follow to prevent mistakes, and a fault isolation manual where engineers have figured out the best way to find the issue.   Many technicians will troubleshoot and order parts, then wait for the parts to come in - they have plenty of other work on other aircraft.  When those parts don't fix the issue, then the process repeats itself.  Technician knowledge and skill, available functional and calibrated tools, available proper maintenance manual libraries (iPads!), a good work atmosphere, proper technician manning, a well designed integrated fault reporting system, a well-designed aircraft, an aircraft designed with the maintenance technician in mind, and available test equipment all contribute to the pace of operations when it comes to aircraft maintenance, and ultimately the bottom line for the organization.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"25th Aug, 2020","answer_content":"Thank you so much Mr. Anthony Dean.

The principle of minimum magnetic field strength in the central region of the reactor is used. This allows us to eliminate the fluxes of charged particles on the walls of the reactor chamber. However, magnetic isolation does not allow the elimination of particle fluxes that appear in the plasma due to formation of electrical domains under the influence of electrons which runaway from collisions in azimutal direction. In the plasma, in the presence of a magnetic field always exists a domain instability ((see my results in Proc. EPS Conferences on Plasma Physics). Attempts to obtain a nuclear fusion reaction using hot plasma in a tokamak reactor chamber are unpromising. The thermonuclear fusion is humanity's gold dream or very deep error of theorists.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"18th Jul, 2017","answer_content":"Basically, magnetic field suppresses transport of mass and energy from the plasma core (where nuclear reactions are supposed to occur) and the material walls of the chamber which contains the plasma; should this suppression fail, excessive plasma cooling would prevent nuclei to achieve fusion. The field is also supposed to prevent particles coming out of the wall to enter the plasma core; indeed, the slightest contamination of the core raises X.ray radiation to unacceptable leve, leading once again to plasma cooling. Trouble is, the system made of the plasma and the magnetic field is often far from stable, as plasma itself is an excellent electric conductor, and even small electric currents flowing across it modify the field. Research on stability is one of the oldest topics in fusion research; ot date, it has been only partially successful.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"18th Jul, 2017","answer_content":"We may wonder how large is the magnetic field required for successful nuclear fusion. Sadly, it is not really a matter of intensity, but of shape of the magnetic field lines. Open field lines are easily to design and to be put in practice, but obviously confine plasma only scarcely in its motion along the filed lines themselves (Lorenz force along the magneitc field lines vanishes identically). So, people decided to develop configurationswith magnetic field with closed field lines. Among these configurations, just a few are stable. Stable configurations may either be entirely ruled by external coils (i.e., absolutely no current across the plasma) or induce a current across the plasma to sustain the field. Today, the former case corresponds to stellarators, which are well known although of almost unbearable engineering complexity; the latter case corresponds to reversed field pinches and tokamaks, which differ from each other according to the stabilization mechanism (a delicate interplay of plasma turbulence and external coils in reversed field pinch, a huge magnetic field superimposed by the external world in tokamas, where the plasma carries just the current which is responsible for heating and the confinining magnetic field). Reversed field pinch have laughable confinement properties (to date, at least). Tokamaks perform much better, but at the price of enormous magnetic energy and related stresses. Do rule-of-thumb rules exist? Sure thing, but quite pessimistic indeed: older estimates predicted that the power losses away from the plasma decrease with the square of the magnetic field intensity, recent (and more realistic) scaling laws predict that power losses decrease just with the first power of the magnetic field intensity. As a result, look at ITER: the plasma is so huge just to make the travel of the pwer from the core towards the walls a bit onger, as the field is barely enough to stabilize it.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"18th Jul, 2017","answer_content":"Analysis shows that plasma in technical devices can exist for a long time only at continuous supply of energy to it. In this case, recombination is balanced by ionization. In nature, a rare cosmic plasma stably exists - because of the low density, there is not a particle of another sort for recombination next to it.Millions of years exists a stars and tens of minutes exists a ball lightning -  structures like the electrical domain of a spherical shape. Stability conditions are given in my article:  “An investigation of the generation and properties of laboratory-produced ball lightning” Journal of Plasma Physics,  Cambridge,2015. Continuous existence of a ball lightning takes place when the following conditions are satisfied:1. The ball lightning kernel is located in the area with the minimum of induction of the poloidal magnetic field which creates a circular current existing in the external spherical layer. The charged particles of the kernel cannot move in the direction of increasing the magnetic field induction;2. The excess charge of one sort and the lack of charge of other sort in the kernel or in the external spherical layer significantly reduces the possibility of an electron capture by the nearest ion, therefore the recombination processes in a ball lightning becomes difficult;3. The inequality of positive and negative charges in the elements of ball lightning also significantly reduces the losses of charged plasma due to bremsstrahlung;4. The resultant of all forces, including the force of electrostatic interaction between the elements of a ball lightning, the force of Lorentz, the force of gas-kinetic pressure and the force caused by the centripetal acceleration should be equal to zero in the equatorial plane;5. It is possible that a reaction of nuclear fusion takes place due to the existence of strong fields in the ball lightning and the presence of deuterium in a water vapor in the atmosphere.The splashs of neutron generation during the passage of ball lightning in the laboratory were obtained a month ago and results were reported on ICPIG2017 in Estoril. Ball lightning with a diameter of 0.94 meters was obtained earlier and published in the materials of the Zvenigorod conference on plasma physics and contolled fusion (available on the website). I have no desire and time to participate further in this discussion due to lack of prospects of magnetic insulation to solve the energy problem.

Electro-Magnets surround the chamber/reactor and are pulsed adiabatically (as in a bicycle pump) and the gas becomes extremely hot that may melt the surroundings. The fusion process releases large amounts of very high speed neutrons which impinge against an absorbent wall heating it up. Behind the wall  are a series of circulating water pipes, where the water turns to steam, then the steam turns a turbine attached to a generator to produce electricity.

Knowles laid out those adult learning characteristics that were, generally speaking, the differences between adult and traditional or younger learners.One of the key differences I still firmly hold is the level at which children and young adults and traditional adult learners process information. Adults are more capable to synthesize and form a deeper cognitive understanding of the material than younger students due to experience. Experience is a key factor in Knowles' theory, and it's true that adults come to learning with more experience under their belts than younger students. But experience can also form biases against new learning, thus slowing or halting the learning process altogether.What I have been seeing is how much more alike traditional students are now to adults when referring to adult learning principles. For example, of the six principles Knowles mentioned, today's students also desire in or from their learning and teaching:- Internally motivated and self-directed (We are ALL motivated somehow to learn, and if we can reach the student and make what is being taught internal to them, then learning is far easier. Today's students are also more self-directed at a certain level than previously; we need to address that in the classrooms).- Life experiences  (While adults have acquired a wealth of life experience to bring to the classroom, traditional students, too, are now more experienced in things that we, at their age, never had to deal with. This is something to tap into when trying to form intrinsic motivation in learning.)- Goal-oriented (Today's students have goals that either motivate them to learn or motivate them to drop out. While they may not be as concrete and reachable as the goals of an adult, we must still realize that and use that in teaching.)- Relevancy-oriented (This, above most others, is important. WHY is it that they have to learn what is being taught? Why is Macbeth relevant to the modern 12th grade senior? What is the relevancy of learning art or music or algebra? Form those relationships and relevancy connects and they will learn!)- Practical (Students want what they learn to actually be usable in the real world. Thus the age-old question, \"When will I ever use algebra in my life outside of the classroom?\" To which one can reply, every day...but give them practical examples of HOW they will use it.)- Respect (We ALL want to be respected. Unfortunately, today's young students make it hard. They come from broken homes, homeless, fatherless, poverty, racial inequality, etc. We need to realize that respect can be given freely, even if it is not earned.

Understand that no specific age references the onset of adulthood.Based on the adragogical model of adult education, the six assumptions of andragogy are 1) self-concept, 2) experience (what one respondent called “baggage”), 3) readiness to learn depends on need, 4) problem-centered focus, 5) internal motivation, and 6) the adult need to know why a learning task is essential. Arguably, some of these principles may apply to children, but as a collective unifying theory of educating them, they do not. So, let’s explore the six tenets of adult learning and education.1)    Self-concept. Self-concept refers to an adult becoming more self-directed and independent as he/she matures.  Adults generally want to choose what they want or need to learn, when they want to learn it, and how they want to know it.  This principle of andragogy means that educators can provide more choices for learners to learn in different and varying ways – including collaboration.2)    Experience.  Adult learners have a wealth and depth of life experiences that they bring into a new learning arena.  Because of this, adult learners can contribute richness to class discussions and the learning process. Such life knowledge can make the adult learner a valuable resource for others to learn.3)    Readiness to learn depends on need. Whether an adult is ready to learn depends on what they need to know to deal with life situations. In other words, the learning must be relevant and applicable.4)    Problem centered focus.  Adults need to see the immediate application of their learning. Therefore, they seek learning opportunities that will enable them to solve problems. Many adults engage in learning opportunities merely to solve a problem. 5)    Internal motivation. Adults may seek learning opportunities due to some external motivator (e.g., work requirement or a financial need), and the more potent motivators (self-esteem, a better quality of life, self-actualization, etc.) are internal.6)    Adults need to know why they need to learn something.  Adults need to know, “…what’s in it for me?”  The adult learner needs to see how this new knowledge will help them to solve a problem or how this knowledge can be immediately applied.References:Knowles, M.

The traditional learning model naturally requires that children depend upon adults for the next lesson, the next assignment, and the next subject matter. Adult learning turns this paradigm on its head, by making the study of most subjects a self-directed endeavor. For the adult learner, less structure and oversight is required by the educator.• Adults challenge new information, but younger students implicitly accept it. We'd have a problem on our hands if our nine-year old students questioned the legitimacy of their multiplication tables or were skeptical about the spherical shape of the earth. For adult students, however, skepticism is part of the path to learning. It's not just expected; it's encouraged. The way that adults learn best is by challenging new ideas, comparing them to preconceived notions, life lessons, and other information, thereby cementing the new information into their minds.• Adults pursue education with immediate application and relevance, whereas younger students simply engage in education without a clear sense of direction. It's obvious that a fifth-grader hasn't pegged his career path, thereby applying his geography lesson to his future job as an airline pilot. By contrast, most adults are already well into their career path. Thus, their education has immediate application to their daily life. Being able to walk from the classroom into the office makes one's education truly applicable. For this reason, adults enter degree programs and areas of education that will immediately enhance their career, meet their needs, or solve their current problems. For the adult, education is relevant.• Adults accept responsibility for their own learning, whereas younger students attribute educational responsibility to a parent or guardian. How adults learn is how adults live-according to their responsibility. After a childhood or teen years of dependency, the adult must now make his or her own decisions, even in education. Thus, the adult student will accept the responsibility-pass or fail-for his or her education and learning.Source: https://www.ccu.edu","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"4"},{"answer_post_date":"27th Aug, 2021","answer_content":"Ahmed T.

Or was Haiti used to strike back in Trump's war of words?\nWithin  the impossibility exists the possibility that Trump said it or did not  say it....... The probability to believe that Trump said it is much  higher ------ and Trump himself is the cause of it...... If Trump,  really, did say it, then Trump should go back to primary school...study  basic world history...and someone should make sure that Trump does not  skip classes.\nNowadays Haiti is used to promote anything..... If  something is B-list and wants to ascend to A-list, the plight of the  poor in Haiti is by far the most effective tools to promote its  marketability and playability to the worldwide audience...\nWhile  Haiti commemorates the devastating 2010 Earthquake --- which killed  300000 people and wounded 350000 people --- suddenly, a Trump scandal  about Haiti/Africa/Norway goes viral and then the Swedish (H&M)  scandal about Black/White goes also viral.\nWhy so much 'war of words' against Haiti?\nWithout Haiti, the USA would, in fact, be a 'Shithole'.\nLet history speak for itself!\nHaiti  is the country that makes the USA won the incredible deal of Louisiana  from France. Why would Trump call Haiti 'Shithole' in 2018? Or perhaps  the Secrets of Haiti are not just hidden but buried by the Pentagon —  Central Intelligence Agency, with all kinds of manipulation.\nHaiti fought to make the USA great...but the USA turned its backs on Haiti.\nThe  Haitian Revolution was not just a fight to end slavery but a fight to  change the human condition, all over the world, regardless of your skin  color. That is why it is the greatest revolution ever!\nBack then,  France did not know the value of Haiti's geophysics..... If Napoleon  only knew that the people of Haiti were sitting on trillions and  trillions of dollars of the most valuable minerals on Earth --- Oh Lord,  my God, Grant us your Peace --- the re-conquest of paradise would not  just be a Battle of Verdun (showcase of French patriotism against Nazi  Germany), but it would be a battle to Bleed Europe White.... Napoleon of  France would recruit all the mercenary soldiers of Europe and fight to  the last breath to reconquer Haiti.... The USA would not stand a chance  to win the Battle of Savannah... Spain was already bankrupt and sold  most of its colonies to France... England and France would either battle  each in the Caribbean or together they would re-colonize both Haiti and  the USA. Hence, the USA would not stand a chance to exist. There would  not be a Fourth of July. Today, kingdom and servitude would have mutated  to a more ferocious form.\nIn 1993, president Aristide  desperately tried to have a dialogue with the Great Powers to fix the  Haiti problem, but he failed and was sent to exile in 1994. The Great  Powers did not give Aristide a chance to finish his presidency.\nThen  president Aristide was rightfully restored to power in Haiti and  re-tried to solve the Haiti problem --- but with \"Secret-Reinsurance  Treaties\" --- the same dangerous diplomacy and politics which caused  WWI.\nThe Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti (FRAPH)  ---- a CIA-paramilitary operation, organized in mid-1993, together with  spy agents and informants from Haitian and Dominican opposition parties,  as well as clandestine expatriates on CIA payroll ---- was used to  de-stabilize Haiti, in order to send president Aristide back to  Africa....\nThe Aristide regime released evidence to make it  obvious that the USA, in fact, played a significant role in establishing  and funding FRAPH. The CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)  got publicly exposed in the matter. The Center for Constitutional Rights  (CCR) obtained thousands of pages of newly declassified U.S. documents,  which explicitly proved the involvement of CIA and DIA in financing  FRAPH. Then CCR lawyers accused CIA/DIA of committing terrorist acts  against the Haitian people...\nAt the end of the day, the CCR also failed to solve the Haiti problem.\nThen president Aristide tried his plan C..D..E...etc...All plans failed!\nLast  but not least, president Aristide played an extremely dangerous game  with the USA with his secret pacts signed with France and South  Africa........\nFirst, South Africa sent military ship to stabilize Haiti, along with a shipment of weapons to Haiti.\nPresident  Aristide attempted to solve the Haiti problem, in the same way North  Korea is doing today, with the help of Russia and China, with the  politics of nuclear deterrence.\nThe Aristide regine have tried to  solve the Haiti problem by signing direct and indirect pacts with Cuba,  Venezuela, Russia and China, to develop a mining industry in Haiti. The  USA responded with embargo, and the rich mafia families which control  the economy of Haiti terrorize the Haitian population.\nMedia  rumors and propaganda said that South Africa is mining oil, uranium,  plutonium, iridium, zirconium, and other precious metals in Haiti to  build nuclear energy and possibly nuclear bombs...\nThe presence  of South Africa in Haiti made the USA enforced the new policy of the  \"Monroe Doctrine\" --- i.e. problems in the Americas are to be fixed by  the USA.\nThe South African military ship was forced to leave Haiti --- wide-open to further destabilization by FRAPH.\nPresident  Aristide told France that it has a special obligation to Haiti, as per  secret treaty and for robbing Haiti's economy from 1825 -to-1947, with a  gold ransom valued at $40 billion.\nIn 2000, feeling of war spurring quickly renewed interest in Haiti, due to the strategic importance of the island.\nHowever, president Aristide had made a miscalculation by putting pressure on France to pay Haiti back the $40-billion gold.\nIn retaliation, France did not show up on time...\nThen  president Aristide was kidnapped, a second time, by US special forces,  sent back to exile, and was told once-and-for-good (for the last time)  stay in Africa and do not come back to Haiti.\nHaiti became a Wild-Wild-West (lawless) land....\nFrance dispatched a nuclear war ship, in the pretext to restore order in Haiti.\nThe USA responded with two nuclear war ships.\nFortunately  the lessons of WWII teach politicians to solve such disputes at the UN  --- a peace-keeping organization, which rose from the ashes of WWII.\nThe  Haiti dispute was resolved, in a de-facto manner, by the UN Security  Council, to avoid a World War III from spreading around the globe, to  spare the current and succeeding generations from the scourge of another  global armed conflict.\nIn 2004, the UN created the MINUSTAH  (Mission des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation en Haïti) (United  Nations Stabilization Mission In Haiti).\nNevertheless, the 2010 Haiti earthquake clearly proved that MINUSTAH was, also, a failure.\nIn 2010, Haiti became again a battlefield for the Great Powers.\nFrance  --- followed by international organizations like Doctors Without  Borders, Red Cross, UNICEF, and others --- quickly rushed to Haiti, to  bring in humanitarian aid.\nInstead of humanitarian aid, the USA  sent a nuclear war ship and ten of thousands of soldiers to Haiti. The  USA occupied all airports and ports, blocked and turned away all  emergency humanitarian supply from France and other countries.\nThen  France accused the USA of occupying Haiti and filed an appeal-complaint  for the intervention of UN, as well as for a clarification on the role  of the USA in Haiti...\nThen Haiti got a fatal assistance, in return.\nThe so-called \"$15-billion in donation to rebuild Haiti\" did not happen...\nMost of the money offered to Haiti were actually loans that Haiti never received and must pay back fake interest --- as usual.\nHumanitarian workers were played...\nThe donation was a pledge to the mirror -- i.e. the money circles back to its donors.\nThe rest of the story is purposely left for readers to do their own philosophical and allegorical interpretation.\nThe End.","question_tags":["South Africa","Humanitarian Aid","Europe","World History","Haiti"]},[{"answer_post_date":"12th Mar, 2018","answer_content":"  No Haitian Revolution ","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"3rd Jun, 2018","answer_content":"https://www.alternatehistory.com/.../no-haitian-revolution.278000/","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"3rd Jun, 2018","answer_content":"Interesting","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"count":3}]],[{"question_post_date":"7th Feb, 2019","question_title":"What impact will global warming have on the migration of the population?","question_image_url":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dariusz-Prokopowicz/post/What-impact-will-global-warming-have-on-the-migration-of-the-population/attachment/5c5bd6bacfe4a781a57d90dd/AS%3A723564458168320%401549522618643/image/DISCUSSION_D.Prokopowicz_.What+impact+will+global+warming+have+on+the+migration+of+the+population.jpg","question_content":"In connection with the warming of the Earth's climate, progressive global warming, some areas located in the sub-tropical zone in the future will not be fit for existence, and the migration processes of the population will be intensified.Do you agree with my opinion?Please replyBest wishes","question_tags":["Global Warming","Climate","Migration","Population","Demography and Population Studies","Social Science","Earth (Planet)","Earth Sciences"]},[{"answer_post_date":"7th Feb, 2019","answer_content":"Natural rates of migration won't be able to keep up.

Of course, we are talking about a long time ago, there was no Internet, and less than Google maps. The methods of creating images differs between the two techniques, as does the application of such images most of the time. Aerial photogeology of the Earth´s surface is a passive form of remote sensing generated from cameras mounted on aircraft, satellites and another spacecraft. The photos are taken every 10 to 30 s as an aircraft follows a systematic overlapping flight pattern at a fixed altitude. Each picture slightly overlaps the preceding one so that a stereoscopic or 3D image can be produced to a easily geological interpretation. The spectral sensitivity of aerial photogeology is limited portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, e.g., from low-frequency radio waves through gamma-ray, and, therefore, the photo geology is not restricted by time of the day, weather conditions, and environmental variances.The Photogeology is still a usual field within Geology, but the study of aerial photographs can't substitute the field investigations but rather it helps and contributes to them. The advantages of the study of the aerial photographs can be listed as follows:a. it saves timeb. it provides to observe a larger areac. it has more detailed ground surface than mapsd. photographs can be studied anytime and at anywheree. studies carried out on the photographs are cheaper than studies in the fieldf. studies carried out on the aerial photographs are easier than studies in the field.I attached a useful material for your better comprehension, best wishes, Mario E.

Web based software can be complicated to manage outside the dedicated web environment. Free to use or freemium software has been a bit of a market disrupter.  Sometimes underdeveloped, problems can take time to sort out.

This change of terminology was adopted by the European Commission, more or less during the drafting of the CCS Directive, if I recall well. In contradiction to its 'temporary' character, in the EU sequestration will commonly be used for all non-geological storage (biomass, soils, etc.). Outside of the EU, sequestration remains to be used for geological storage (e.g. CSLF).

Early childhood education need to rethink some concepts related to teaching and learning. Non-canonical, canonical and symbolic uses can be the foundational stone to implement educational and familiar  planning and practices linked with children´s development. Our research deals with the description and development of uses of objects during mealtimes from a pragmatic perspective. Food not only nurtures children but also facilitates the construction of cultural knowledge, practices, and meanings regarding the group they belong to. However, triadic interactions (adult-object- children) related to food and use of the objects in educational settings are still little researched.Through shared actions with caregivers, children acquire knowledge as long as caregivers make appropriate use of objects during mealtimes to signify children’s reality. Meals involve learning mechanism about the culture, others and social contexts. With the aim of a better understanding of eating processes in schools and how they go far beyond nutrition, this speech presents our first evidences on this topic. Since 2017, we are working on research that aims to analyze the use of objects, meals and educational practices in Early Childhood Education. Microgenetic analysis and methodological innovations are used to obtain specific data linked with our theoretical objectives. Therefore, we chose three researches, still in process of being published or finished, which reveal some important data to be introduced: Rengifo-Herrera & Rodrigues (In press) show educational practices involving use of objects and meals with 1 years old babies. Likewise, Alencar & Rengifo-Herrera (2019) analyzed objects, food and plays with 3 years old children. Finally, Rengifo-Herrera e Ribeiro (manuscript in preparation) show specific data that allow to describe how caregivers (family and care day teachers) support the introducing solid food and the use of the objects in the first six months old.All these data are collected in Brasilia´s care day centers (public and private); Understanding the pragmatic, cognitive and, semiotic relationships that emerge during mealtimes could favor innovative practices for early childhood education and give us new opportunities to analyze children’s psychological development as well as care and educational processes in Early Childhood Education.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"count":5}]],[{"question_post_date":"14th Feb, 2018","question_title":"What justifies our treatment of animals?","question_image_url":null,"question_content":"Is it reason, intelligence, superior nature, rights, or something else?","question_tags":["Intelligence","Reasoning","Animals","Ethics","Environmentalism","Environmental Ethics","Morality","Virtues"]},[{"answer_post_date":"14th Feb, 2018","answer_content":"Treatment of things is absolutely necessary for any living creature.

However, I will only list one real world example for this case study, due in part, because cultural belief can cause some of the worst social pathological behavior to manifest and  I,for one, wouldn't want to stir a psychological hornets nest. And that's why I've been very hesitant to get involved on a political level in the context of this case study. The reason I'm referring this case study to you ( the scientific community) is due to the fact that the more logical minds think about any particular problem the more probable a solution can be found to mitigate that problem. Case Study:A community is seriously contaminating the air they breath with toxic smoke (there isn't a \"healthy\" smoke). Whilst they do have the choice to not emit toxic smoke in there local environment.e.g. By using more cleaner technologies to heat there homes. They \"choose\" not to. The reasons why this form of social self harm exists (other than when there is no choice.e.g. Burn Coal or freeze) is only because of ignorance in most  cases. This ignorance is based on a central cultural presumption. A belief that blinds them from the facts, thus they act without due care and attention. Fact 1.The community (a significant percentage of the people in the community that contribute towards a negative health difference to the overall air quality)  are choosing to behave in a way that, evidence has shown, seriously harms health ( e.g. Coal/wood smoke is far more toxic than cigarette smoke). Fact 2.They don't (are not cognitively indoctrinated too) accept the facts due to a habitual cognitive bias ( driven in part by a religious upbringing in which they are indoctrinated in such away that they avoid certain facts that contradicts their central premise (belief/opinion) and or ideological/financial incentive).Fact 3. local industry actively promotes ( and part takes) in the ritual of  burning stuff in the local environment and is financially motivated to promote the burning of wood and coal. Fact 4. The culture is comparably wealthy in so that most (if not all) do not even consider the alternative cleaner options. New homes are built and coal fire places and or wood burners are installed. Fact 5. The local governing bodies are part of the coal/wood burning culture thus are not interested in mitigating the problem (e.g. Smoke control regulations). Fact 6. Some of the narratives promoted by local business (  financially associated within the tree to burning wood economy) suggest  that burning wood for heating is a sustainable method to mitigate climate change.i.e. Tree's fix Carbon from the air and burning  wood  releases the carbon back into the Air ( and in local peoples lungs). Whilst this narrative is correct, they then go on to add the \"carbon neutral\" narrative, which is completely incorrect. For example, it takes a lot of industry (predominantly a diesel driven industry) to grow tree plantations and get those tree's processed and into houses as logs. Furthermore, the conifer tree plantations take up most of the forested areas of the local landscape and being of a monoculture design, are not self sustaining in the long term.e.g. Loss of fertile soils and loss of the carbon ( carbon capture cycle. Thus on a large scale disruptive to the ecosystem ).  So given the particulates (sorry, pun intended), the particulars of this case, does anyone have any suggestions what methods could be used in order to reduce smoke emissions thus improve the general health of the area. Other than replacing the entire culture with more intelligent thoughtful people, I'm at a loss in how to help these poor \"souls\" out.

Changing those patterns of thinking evidently can't be done simply confronting the general issue – that's what already hasn't worked.

Nor is the community generally sensitive to how insidious those effects are. Your audience in the community finds some sources of information more credible than others. Find out who that is and recruit that person, organization, agency or whoever to provide the credible face of your campaign. Then, focus on the already documented direct health effects of smoke on the health of the children in the community. People of all doctrinal persuasions have children and everybody wants to protect the kids. Thus it ceases to be an issue based on ideology or politics. People typically respond positively to respectful, positively presented ideas.      It will take a generation to make substantial progress in a campaign like this.

They experimented on various sites in the subcontinent which was then a part of their Great Empire and what ever they discovered  they published it for the benefit of general public.

By the first quarter of the 20th century systematic publications on archaeology were coming up, however, the WWI and then WWII slowed down the activities of the archeologists until as you  say 1950s onwards, regular books with color plates were made available and lots of institutions such as British School of Archaeology, London came into existence.  The Museums such as BM and V&A also played an important role in popularizing archaeology and became point of attraction for general public, the role which they still play.So I would say that Archaeology as a scientific subject started in the mid 19th Century but unfortunately the earlier archaeologist are forgotten in the glittering of modern world.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"10th Oct, 2012","answer_content":"Depends, in part on you're definition of 'scientificaly'.

By the same, Trigger contradicted his own view that early archaeology was only “descriptive” or “culture-historical”. Moreover, Trigger stressed that “Worsaae also played an important role in developing interdisciplinary research related to archaeology”. Numerous archaeologists did their research in archaeology in a way akin to natural scientists. Early archaeology cooperated closely with geology, biology and nomothetically oriented anthropology.In the 19th century, further important concepts appeared in archaeology. One of them, published by Sven Nilsson (1787−1883), demonstrated the economic development of man from hunting and fishing through nomadic herding and early farming to civilization. Nilsson’s four stages corresponded with Thomsen’s Three-Age scheme, making it much more apparent. Nilsson’s concept was later adopted and accepted by almost all the specialists working in human history. Both chronological schemes accepted the idea that human societies everywhere followed the same general course of development, although clearly not all at the same space and time. The two should be treated as the founding theories of archaeological research.More about scientific aspects of archaeology you will find in my paper \"Epistemological status of archaeology – current controversies\" (enclosed in ResearchGate).","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"3"},{"answer_post_date":"14th Nov, 2012","answer_content":"primero define \"arqueología\" y define \"científicamente\". caso contrario aparecerá arena movediza, pues no creo que exista acuerdo unánime al respecto,   ","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"14th Nov, 2012","answer_content":"thank you but I don't know this language, could you come again in English please?","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"16th Nov, 2012","answer_content":"Dear Alicia Colson,I thank you very much for your help in translating the last question.

An antique has value for what we know about it or think we know about it.  Antiquarians interested in history, many who collected \"antiquities\" sometimes by excavation, ascribed the objects to \"known\" historical contexts -- using classical literature (e.g. Heroditus, Julius Caesar) or the bible.

I avoid a \"technical\" answer because you cannot fault these early scholars for lacking radiocarbon dating, back-scatter SEM and stable-isotope analysis or other \"science\" that were simply not available..  I use \"philosophical\" criteria. Eighteenth and 19th century Antiquarians already \"knew\" all the answers were contained in extant historical and biblical literature used in addressing Antiquity and Antiquities.  C.J. Thomsen, by the way, was not well versed in the Antiquarian literature.  He was a wealthy merchant and banker who addressed the national museum chaos of the relics collections as a merchant taking an inventory.  The brilliance of his intuitive 3-age classification was probably not explicitly intended although he did use Stone AGE, Bronze AGE, and Iron AGE explicitly.  He did not necessarily present this as a progressive sequence of technological periods of ancient history -- as so many others (Woorsae, etc.) realized. Thomsen, himself, described the Stone Age as a \"time when metal was too expensive.\"  It was not an ancient period of history, it was an economic condition -- quite reasonable to the mind of a merchant banker.  It is probably a happy accident of the history of science that Thomsen was not an antiquarian scholar or he might well have used the scientifically barren antiquarian method in organizing the Danish museum.Philosophically, the 3-Age System was profoundly important.  The Biblical Garden of Eden myth considers the human condition to be in decline -- a \"fall from grace\" and expulsion from the Garden of Eden, the paradise on earth.  The Classical 4-Age System, a sequence of Gold, Silver, Bronze and Iron Ages, likewise considered the human condition to be in decline since the end of the Golden Age (or more accurately, the Silver Age when humans appear joining the immortals).  Moreover, there was virtually no effective distinction made between the truly mythological Gold and Silver Ages and the historically valid Bronze and Iron Ages -- at least not as far as any archaeological science is associated with this scheme.  Thomsen's 3-Age scheme contradicted the Classical and Biblical perceptions of decline by proposing a technological (and economic) progression to the improvement of the human condition.I expect that many early scholars of antiquity rejected the Antiquarian method, including notable members of the Royal Antiquarian Society of London.  For example, Sir Richard Colt Hoare (and others, e.g.,  William Dugdale, if my faulty memory is correct)  excavated ancient barrows.  Colt Hoare authored a volume, Ancient Wilshire ( I hope I have this correctly) around the turn of the 19th century,  explicitly rejecting antiquarianism by expresseing \"ignorance\" as to who were the builders of those ancient monuments.  Recognition of such ignorance is the first step to inquiry and inquiry is the basis of science.  Without reliance on classical and biblical literature, new scientific inquiry was directed toward careful and critical examination of the relics of antiquity to generate new knowledge.Similarly, Boucher de Perthes, in France, based on the recover of stone tools from the Somme gravels, argued (futilely for many years) for a human period of Prehistory (Prehistoire) not covered by written documentation of any kind, likewise rejecting the antiquarian methods. My answer, then, is:   Archaeology as a science begins when false confidence in Antiquarian knowledge gives way to critical inquiry to resolve (and eliminate) recognized areas of ignorance regarding human history.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"2"},{"answer_post_date":"14th Jan, 2013","answer_content":"That's it, Thanks a lot for being patient and specific to such a detail and with such a passion.

In my view, he is quite right to ask you to define your terms, because this has tremendous implications for your question. First of all, while he perhaps overstates the problematic nature of the term \"archaeology,\" there is still some wiggle room there that is too often overlooked. For example, the fact that archaeology as a discipline is usually housed in Classics departments in Europe, whereas it is more often a part of anthropology departments in American universities, has important implications for just what you mean by archaeology in terms of methodology, goals, etc. Most important, however, is the issue of \"scientific\" archaeology. In fact, to be perfectly blunt, your question is methodologically naive. As worded, it reflects a couple of tacit assumptions: first, that archaeology as presently construed IS scientific, and second, that there is a genuine consensus over just what that means. If you accept the argument of Irwin Rovner above, namely that the transition to \"scientific\" archaeology is nothing more than a rejection of earlier antiquarian notions, or discontinuing the prioritization of literary over material evidence, then perhaps you could say without too much trouble that archaeology is indeed scientific. However, you would still be faced with the dilemma of what to do about biblical archaeology... On the other hand, I think that most archaeologists would argue that the issue is far more complicated. In fact, this is one of the major points raised by the so-called post-processual movement of Hodder, Tilley, and others. Post-processualists are openly critical of positivist claims to scientific objectivity to which many archaeologists have laid claim. pointing out the degree to which archaeologists inevitably impose their own views on their interpretation of the evidence. These are precisely the kinds of questions raised by Shanks and Tilley, for instance, when they argue that the representation of archaeology as a science stems from a lack of recognition of the subjectivity of archaeology in practice. As a result, I return to Marcos' first point that \"scientifically\" is a term that demands much more careful consideration that you have given it.  This is a very loaded term, and one that has tremendous implications. For example, you might take a look at the fairly recent coverage of the decision made by the American Anthropological Association to remove reference to \"science\" in their mission statement for just one instance of how thorny an issue this can be.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"2"},{"answer_post_date":"","answer_content":"There is no simple answer to this question.

It is dependant on the definitions that are being used and the point that is trying to be made by the argument and on a wider basis how todays society judges what is a science and what is not. I like to think it is an agglomeration of and ever changing suit of scientific techniques and theory, but someone on a department wanting to maintain funding may want to argue it as a long standing scientific subject (as sciences are more favoured by the governement for funding then humanities are at the moment).

However, European archaeologists have developed separate archaeology programs while American archaeologists have developed them within anthropolog programs. This has led to the culture history and culture process versions of archaeology we have today. Both approaches stress the careful, meticulus excavation of sites, and have more recently promoted leaving parts of sites unexcavated so that future archaeologists can apply new techniques to their excavation.           However, the two groups differ substantially in how they develop and apply theory, more properly described as hypothesis building, to archeology. Culture history tends to be descriptive and more inductive, while culture process tends to be more analytical and deductive. I fall on the culture process side. As a graduate student I was strongly influenced by the growing body of taphonomic, theoretical, and processual literature work produced by Behrensmeyer, Watson, Binford, Gifford-Gonzalez, nd many others. The scientific method, deductive reasoning, the replication of results, and critical thinking were and are the basis of my thinking as an archaeologist.     I have noted that the culture history school has become more ascendant of late; but the culture process school is still very active, though not as vocal or central to the debate as it once was. Today's archaeologists are a mixed group when it comes to the use of science in archaeology. Most certainly use the tools provided by science to make archaeology easier. But many still see it as more of a descriptive art than a true science, so the debate is not over. Perhaps the best example of this is the contentious literature produced by East African archaeologists regarding human origins and how to interpret archaeofauna.

Unfortunately, there is no easy answer to your question. Archaeologists have always been happy to use the tools of science, but they have been slow to adopt the scientific method itself. Many are openly hostile to science as a way of thinking and will never accept it.The most direct answer to your question would be to cite the work of Isaac and Binford. Beginning in the 1960's, Isaac began to use the scientific method to address questions of human origins in East Africa. Blumenschine's review of his work (Breakfast at Olorgesailie, J Hum Evol, 21:307-327) nicely summarizes Isaac's contribution to what is now called paleoanthropology. As Isaac's student, Blumenschine's own work greatly expands the attempt to make archaeology scientific. Binford's body of work affected both Isaac and Blumenschine, and many others, and is probably the most cited source regarding the use of science in archaeology. Binford was a great theorist, and his processual approach is uniformitarian in the best tradition of Hutton and Lyell. More importantly, it is scientific because it is testable, in the best tradition of Popper. At its heart, science must be testable; otherwise it is not science.Many others have contributed to making archaeology scientific. In addition to Behrensmeyer and Gifford-Gonzalez I can cite Bonnichen, Brain, Crader, Gould, Haynes, Johnson, Lyman, Schiffer, Shipman, and Walker to name a few. Looking thru Binford's references in \"Bones\" provides a history of how people have applied science to archaeology for almost 200 years. You can even go back to Thomas Jefferson's excavation of a native American mound on his property in 1784 as an example of science in archaeology.Traditionally, archaeologists have used science when it suites them, and they have ignored it when it does not suit them.

This is when many of the principles were developed, with two pivotal foci in Scandinavia (the Nat. Museum of Denmark, where archaeological typology, the stratigraphic method and the three-age system was first articulated), and the Vatican, where Winckelmann's material culture-based Altertumswissenschaft prefigured the birth of Classical arhaeology, the study of iconography, as well as the importance of archaeology for ancient history). An important dimension is the debt of archeaology to other disciplines, such as geology and evolutionary biology on the one hand, and philology and history on the other. There is a lineage of both aspects - a genealogy of the discipline that starts at least since the Renaissance and continues to the present day - which can be traced in the following two books, among others:Trigger, Bruce G. (1989). A history of archaeological thought. Cambridge [Cambridgeshire] ; New York: Cambridge University Press.Schnapp, A. (1996). The discovery of the past: the origins of archaeology.

As a matter of fact Sir William Jones, who put together a group of antiquarians to form the Asiatic Society on 15th January 1784 in Calcuta. The efforts put by Jones had a long backing, of enthusiasts and dilettantes like Tavernier, Finch and Bernier, Thevenot, Careri, Fryer, Ovington, Hamilton, Anquetil du Perron, William Chamber, to name a few, who carried out survey of monuments in various parts of India, earlier.  This endeavour put forward by Jones culminated in the publication of a periodical journal named, Asiatick Researches started in 1788. The journal brought to light the researches, surveys carried out by the society to make the public aware of the antiquarian wealth of India . The continuing fieldwork soon brought to light many antiquities and other remains which were later housed in a museum in 1814. Later, similar societies were started at Bombay (Mumbai) in 1804 and at Madras (Chennai) in 1818.  Then in 1852 Mr. A.F. Bellasis discovered a new site which he identified as Barahminabad in Sindh, (then in greater Hindostan but now in Pakistan) he published his excavation reports in 1856 in the 'Illustrated London News'.  Follwed by Henry Cousens in 1898 and published a voluminous work in 1929 from Bombay as \"Antiquities of Sindh\".

I tried to explain the reasons in the  preface of my book A Philosophical Approach to Quantum Field Theory  (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2017):\n\n\"Consciously or  unconsciously, the construction of any image of the real world relies on  personal beliefs. I hence try to identify and justify my own personal  beliefs thoroughly and in various ways. Sometimes I rely on  philosophical ideas, for example, about space, time, infinity, or  irreversibility; as a theoretical physicist, I have a limited  understanding of philosophy, but that should not keep me from trying my  best to benefit from philosophical ideas. Often I rely on successful  physical theories, principles or methods, such as special relativity,  quantum theory, gauge invariance or renormalization. Typically I need to  do some heuristic mathematical steps to consolidate the various inputs  adopted as my personal beliefs. All these efforts ultimately lead to an  image of nature, in the sense of a mathematical representation, but they  are not part of this image. The final mathematical representation  should convince by its intrinsic logical clarity, mathematical rigor,  and natural beauty.\n\nEmphasis on the importance of beliefs, even  if they are justified by a variety of philosophical and physical ideas,  may irritate the physicist. The philosopher, on the other hand, is used  to the definition of knowledge as true justified belief. But how can  one claim truth for one's justified beliefs? In physics, this happens by  confronting an image of nature with the real world.\n\nAccording to  Pierre Duhem, known to thermodynamicists from the Gibbs-Duhem relation,  and the analytic philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine, only the whole  image rather than individual elements or hypotheses should be tested.  The confrontation of a fully developed image with the real world depends  on all its background assumptions or an even wider web-of-belief,  including the assumed logics (confirmation holism). Following  Boltzmann's approach of deductive representation, the present book  makes an attempt to show how such a testable whole image of fundamental  particle physics can be constructed within the framework of quantum  field theory.\n\nThe focus of this book is on conceptual issues, on  the clarification of the foundations of quantum field theory, and  ultimately even on ontological questions. For our intuitive approach, we  choose to go back to the historical origins of quantum field theory. In  view of the severe problems that had to be overcome on the way to  modern quantum field theory, that may seem to be naive to the experts.  However, with the present-day knowledge and with philosophical guidance,  the intuitive origins can nicely be developed into a perfectly  consistent image of the real world. On the one hand, there is a price to  pay for this: practical calculations, in particular perturbation  methods, are less elegant and more laborious than in other approaches.  Symbolic computation is the modern answer to this challenge. On the  other hand, there is a promising reward: a new stochastic simulation  methodology for quantum field theory emerges naturally from our  approach.\n\nHopefully, the present book motivates physicists to  appreciate philosophical ideas. Epistemology and the philosophy of the  evolution of science often seem to lag behind science and to describe  the developments a posteriori. As philosophical arguments here have a  profound influence on the actual shaping of an image of fundamental  particles and their interactions, this book should stimulate the  curiosity and imagination of physicists.\n\nStudents of physics can  use this book as a reliable companion whenever their standard textbooks  focus on pragmatic calculations and fail to clarify important conceptual  issues; philosophers and physicists interested in the epistemological  foundations of particle physics can use it as a thought-provoking  monograph.

Humans don’t have some a priory completely true information about anything – about themselves, material environment, other humans, etc., and so all/every information about the above humans obtain only at experiments; and logically analyze the information, making inferences, planning deals, developing theories, etc., again only instinctively,- i.e. fundamentally having no any rational imagination – what they themselves are, what is the information, why the information can be analyzed, why sometimes the analyses result is adequate to the reality, and why sometimes aren’t adequate, etc.; and, besides- any experimental outcome fundamentally cannot prove anything – from that the same result is obtained in any number N experiments fundamentally by no means it follows that the N+1th outcome will be the same.Correspondingly any/everything in humans’ sciences and practice really is based only on some fundamentally non-provable – i.e. fundamentally transcendent -  beliefs,- including all/every mainstream philosophical doctrines are based on fundamentally non-provable postulates; and, besides, since philosophy is the science in which, as that was established at its birth near few thousands of years ago, the specific subjects for study are fundamental phenomena/notions Matter,  “Consciousness”, “Space”, “Time”, “Information”, etc.,- however all these phenomena/notions remain in the mainstream till now being  fundamentally transcendent. Correspondingly completely logically inevitably  al/every numerous mainstream philosophical doctrines, sub-doctrines, schools, etc., etc., are really nothing else than some transcendent  mental constructions that are based on numerous transcendent beliefs.I.e. really any/every mainstream philosophical doctrine, etc., by no means differs from any religion, besides only one point – the religions frankly claim that they are transcendent system of transcendent answers on the main questions “What is World”, “What is “human”?”, “What are the place and role of humans in the World?”- whereas all main steam philosophical doctrines, etc., claim that they are completely rational highly intellectual non-transcendent systems; what is again quite evidently a next transcendent belief, however in this case it is quite rationally and truly clear that this belief is for sure wrong.However from  that everything cannot be proven   there exist the unique fundamental exclusion – as that is rigorously proven in the Shevchenko-Tokarevsky’s “The Information as Absolute” conceptionhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/260930711_the_Information_as_Absolute – basing, of course on the experiments, i.e. in this case really everyday humans’ practice, where some informational patterns/systems as a data are observed,- that there exist nothing else than some informational patterns/systems of the patterns that are elements of the absolutely fundamental and absolutely infinite “Information” Set; which - the Set - exists absolutely objectively, because of it fundamentally – logically - cannot be non-existent,  and so exists absolutely “eternally”, having no Beginning and no End;This proof is possible just because of the absolute fundamentality of the phenomenon “Information”, which obtains utmost general definition:“Information is something that is constructed in accordance with the set/system of absolutely fundamental Rules, Possibilities, Quantities, etc. – the set/system “Logos” in the conception”Since that Information, despite of its absolute fundamentality, isn’t a transcendent phenomenon, and since everything is nothing else than some informational patterns/systems, in the conception practically all really fundamental phenomena/notions, including the basic philosophical “Matter” and “Consciousness”, are completely scientifically defined, more see first 10 pages, including section “What is Life” inhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/358801098_Title_page_Article_type_Review_Title_The_informational_physical_model_some_selected_fundamental_problems_in_physics- and in corresponding models of Matter and uniquely really observed now “consciousness on Earth” version, a few dozens of fundamental problems in physics and life sciences, are either solved or essentially clarified; more see the rest pages in the last link above and references in the link.Correspondingly the philosophy can be a really scientific theory only in framework of the conception above, obtaining at that really its quite specific subjects for study – “ontology” of the absolutely fundamental phenomena/notions “Information” and “Information” Set, aimed at answering to ultimately fundamental for humans problems above.In other case, again, fundamentally really nothing will be changed in philosophy, which will remain to consist of two main few thousands of years old doctrines “Materialism”, where materialists believe in some “Matter”, which for  completely transcendent reasons exists, and by completely transcendent ways is eternal and constantly changes; and “Idealism” which for completely transcendent reasons exists, and by completely transcendent ways is eternal and constantly changes; and all what will be possible will be inventions of innumerous yet now other “…isms”.That is another case, that the “The Information as Absolute” paper was rejected by editors of a dozen of mainstream philosophical journals and any mentions about the conception are blocked; why? – see the RG “Comments” section to the last link above.SS posts at least on the visible page in the thread https://www.researchgate.net/post/Of_the_unanswered_questions_in_science_which_one_is_the_most_importantare relevant to this thread question.Cheers","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"0"},{"answer_post_date":"14th Apr, 2022","answer_content":"As a theoretical physicist, I came to the firm belief that philosophy  allows me to do better physics. I tried to explain the reasons in the  preface of my book A Philosophical Approach to Quantum Field Theory  (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2017):\n\n\"Consciously or  unconsciously, the construction of any image of the real world relies on  personal beliefs. I hence try to identify and justify my own personal  beliefs thoroughly and in various ways. Sometimes I rely on  philosophical ideas, for example, about space, time, infinity, or  irreversibility; as a theoretical physicist, I have a limited  understanding of philosophy, but that should not keep me from trying my  best to benefit from philosophical ideas. Often I rely on successful  physical theories, principles or methods, such as special relativity,  quantum theory, gauge invariance or renormalization. Typically I need to  do some heuristic mathematical steps to consolidate the various inputs  adopted as my personal beliefs. All these efforts ultimately lead to an  image of nature, in the sense of a mathematical representation, but they  are not part of this image. The final mathematical representation  should convince by its intrinsic logical clarity, mathematical rigor,  and natural beauty.\n\nEmphasis on the importance of beliefs, even  if they are justified by a variety of philosophical and physical ideas,  may irritate the physicist. The philosopher, on the other hand, is used  to the definition of knowledge as true justified belief. But how can  one claim truth for one's justified beliefs? In physics, this happens by  confronting an image of nature with the real world.\n\nAccording to  Pierre Duhem, known to thermodynamicists from the Gibbs-Duhem relation,  and the analytic philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine, only the whole  image rather than individual elements or hypotheses should be tested.  The confrontation of a fully developed image with the real world depends  on all its background assumptions or an even wider web-of-belief,  including the assumed logics (confirmation holism). Following  Boltzmann's approach of deductive representation, the present book  makes an attempt to show how such a testable whole image of fundamental  particle physics can be constructed within the framework of quantum  field theory.\n\nThe focus of this book is on conceptual issues, on  the clarification of the foundations of quantum field theory, and  ultimately even on ontological questions. For our intuitive approach, we  choose to go back to the historical origins of quantum field theory. In  view of the severe problems that had to be overcome on the way to  modern quantum field theory, that may seem to be naive to the experts.  However, with the present-day knowledge and with philosophical guidance,  the intuitive origins can nicely be developed into a perfectly  consistent image of the real world. On the one hand, there is a price to  pay for this: practical calculations, in particular perturbation  methods, are less elegant and more laborious than in other approaches.  Symbolic computation is the modern answer to this challenge. On the  other hand, there is a promising reward: a new stochastic simulation  methodology for quantum field theory emerges naturally from our  approach.\n\nHopefully, the present book motivates physicists to  appreciate philosophical ideas. Epistemology and the philosophy of the  evolution of science often seem to lag behind science and to describe  the developments a posteriori. As philosophical arguments here have a  profound influence on the actual shaping of an image of fundamental  particles and their interactions, this book should stimulate the  curiosity and imagination of physicists.\n\nStudents of physics can  use this book as a reliable companion whenever their standard textbooks  focus on pragmatic calculations and fail to clarify important conceptual  issues; philosophers and physicists interested in the epistemological  foundations of particle physics can use it as a thought-provoking  monograph. The benefits of an approach resting on philosophical  foundations is twofold: the reader is stimulated to critical thinking  and the entire story flows very naturally, thus removing the mysteries  from quantum field theory.\"","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"4"},{"answer_post_date":"10th May, 2022","answer_content":"Philosophy broadens the range of things one can understand and enjoy.

However, all the 5 points you raised do not answer my question, but instead lead to more questions. I'll show how, by using an example of the most unequal country in the world, South Africa, where I live.POINT #1: Your point about 'financial wealth distribution' not being normal,  because of \"a considerable difference between average and median financial wealth\" (which you say is 'perfectly natural') does not make sense in South Africa and other highly unequal societies. Note that South Africa's population is described as 76.4% \"Black African\", 9.1% \"White\", 8.9% \"Coloured\", 2.5% \"Indian/Asian\", and 0.5% Other/Unspecified. Yet Black Africans earn an average income of R92 983 (US$6,235); Coloureds earn R172 765 (US$11,586); Indians/Asians earn R271 621 (US$ 18216); whites earn R444 446 (US$29,806). Basically, in South Africa, the top 1% of South African earners take home almost 20% of all income in the country, the top 10% take home 65%, and the remaining 90% get only 35% of total income. Now, note that Black Africans are overrepresented in the 90% who get only 35% total income. On the other hand, Whites are overrepresented in the top 10% that take home 65% total income. Black people on average earn 20% of what whites earn. (Of course, there is a small Black elite that earns as much as, if not way more, than the average white earner). We must thus agree that whatever average income we come up with is significantly skewed by the income of Whites that is extremely high and the income of Black people that is extremely low.  In the last count in 2017, 55.5% of South Africa's population was living in poverty (more than 1 in 2, statistically). Black Africans are extremely overrepresented in this 55.5%, and Whites are extremely underrepresented in it. (You could almost say there are no Whites in the 1 in 2 who live in poverty, which does not make sense, but also does make sense). BASICALLY, in cases of inequality such as this, we CANNOT talk of normal distribution or not-normal distribution. There just is NO distribution. A majority of Black people in South Africa have ZERO financial wealth, and thus must not be part of your normal or not-normal distribution of financial wealth. Once you include them, you get very strange (and fake) results.There is a reason you can't continue talking about a distribution. Something just does not make sense: When it comes to bad things (such as prison population, disease, hunger), the stats in South Africa tend to reflect the demographies. Black people naturally dwarf all the other groups in these bad things, because they are 76% of the population. You won't find many whites in the statistics of bad things in South Africa. Now, this is what I would call perfectly natural. BUT when it comes to good things (like high incomes, ownership of companies, good health etc.), Whites, who make up only 9% of the population, are SUDDENLY overrepresented (above 70%) - AND Black people start to disappear from the good things.  You won't find many Blacks in the statistics of good things in South Africa.Why is this the case? You find the same strangeness with statistics of black people in the US in prisons (which numbers do not reflect the population), black people in prisons in Brazil (which numbers do not reflect the population), or Aborigines in Australia in prisons (which numbers do not reflect the population), and the Roma in prisons in Bulgaria (which numbers do not reflect the population). The same goes for black women likely to die in childbirth, compared to white American women. These are the bad things. Yet if you want the statistics of black people in the US, or Aborigines in Australia or Roma in Bulgaria, who are in corporate ownership, high incomes etc. (what I call the good things), SUDDENLY these figures revert to reflecting demographies (that these ethnicities are in a minority, and that whites are in a majority). White people in Brazil and in the US are normally represented/distributed when it comes to the share of good things. Black people in in Brazil and the US are normally overrepresented (to the point of being un-distributed) when it comes to the share of bad things. So, Michael, my question still stands.

But it still does not answer my question. You seem to be answering a question that I did not ask. I did not ask how the high population of poor people has remained \"stable\". The stock answer to that question, given by economists and those who study population, is the one that you have given: that high fertility offsets high mortality (and high mortality offsets high fertility etc.). My contention is that we should surely observe a set of gradual, consistent (or consistently) slight increases in the population of the rich, whatever the dynamics of the population of the poor. Notice that there is no question of the low mortality at birth of the rich (and their low birth rate) offsetting their average low mortality. If there is stability in the population of the rich, it does not seem that it is brought about by any sort of \"offsetting\".My question is: given that the high population of the poor is so-called \"stable\" (due to fertlity offsetting mortality, and mortality offsetting fertility), we must surely also observe something discernible happening within the population of long-living rich people. That is, surely the population graph of long-living rich people should (over 100, 300, 500, 1000, 2000 years) start showing consistent signs of slight increase. The graph should, at least, nudge upwards always, however tiny the uptick. Consistent \"slight increases\" in the population of the rich should, over hundreds or thousands of years when the population of the poor has remained high but stable, become noticeable. Not so? If there was to be a noticeable increase in the population of the rich, however slight each time, it is logical to expect that over time these accumulations of slight increments should be enough to reach and match, or even surpass, the historically \"stable\" population of the much-dying, much-\"breeding\" poor. Indeed, it becomes just a question of time when the rich would become as populous as the poor. It may take 500 years, or it may take take 3000 years, but it seems that it must become inevitable that at some point the rich would be as populous as, or even more populous than, the poor. Your assumption that the \"stability\" in the population of the poor \"contributes to a quite stable proportion between the rich and the poor\" wrongly assumes that the rich are fewer because the poor are many. This would be illogical. The rich are not less because the poor are more. The poor are not more because the rich are less. There is no reason we should not see the rich increase even if and even when the population of the poor remains high (high but stable, stable but high). The poor do not die in large numbers or get born in large numbers because of the growth levels (or lack of them) of the population of the rich.

Wealth? It may be helpful to pose the question in terms of access (as you suggest), as it may bring clarity, or it may hinder us further and throw us into a theoretical no-man’s-land. We can test this by acceding to your preference and restating my original question/puzzle as: how is it that those who do not have access are not eventually outnumbered by those with access? But, immediately, we can see that the problem becomes de-focused and imprecise. Access to what? The complication with posing the problem in terms of access is the risk that everything gets relativized (One man’s access is another man’s non-access; what is access in one locale could be non-access in another etc.), until we no longer know if we are coming or going. As an indicator, access may be revised up or down as authorities fiddle with thresholds, the way they do with the bread line. Also, access may be subject to semantic quibbling or important nuances from place to place and time to time. The supreme advantage of posing the problem in terms of poverty (or wealth) is that being poor is like living in a Petri dish: you are contained, enclosed and displayed in certain places (“dead zones of the world”) which are not that hard to discern and where life, lack and mortality follow a certain discernible pattern. We are never in doubt, for instance, how a favela (Rocinha in Rio) or a barrio (in Caracas, for instance) or a slum (Kibera in Kenya, or Dharavi in Mumbai) is brought about, or how the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 happened the way it did, or why Downtown Eastside Vancouver or Los Pajaritos in (Seville) Spain are the way they are, or why there are more dollar billionaires in the zip codes of downtown Manhattan (Tribeca etc.) than anywhere else in the world but so much hardship in the Zip codes of South Bronx (Crotona East, Morrisania etc.), how and why the division of Detroit by the M-102 (\"8 Mile\"), how and why the ghetto of Stolipinovo in Bulgaria, or Botkyrka and Rinkeby and Tensta and Husby in (Stockholm) Denmark, or Molndal in (Gothenburg) Sweden, or  Bukit Merah and Jalan Kukoh in Singapore, or Oldham (Greater Manchester), or Bwgcolman and Delgamuukw and Jilkminggan and Mungallalla and Yarrabar and Myall Creek in Australia, and Tchula in Mississippi, and  Hill District in Pittsburgh,  are all the way they are, why Israel’s richest neighborhood (Park Tzameret in Tel Aviv) is just three miles away from its poorest one (Ramat Elhanan, in nearby Bnei Brak), why the richest square mile in Africa of Sandton (in South Africa) is just a mile or so away from one of the poorest square miles of Alexandra, and so on. Whether these are problems of access or not, I cannot say. But I know that people in places like Rocinha, Kibera, Dharavi, Grenfell, Ramat Elhanan, Downtown Eastside Vancouver, South Bronx, Los Pajaritos et al live in these Petri dishes of poverty, and that the problem cannot just be posed as one of access.

Do we transmit all of it? Are there historical mechanisms of reshuffling property? The simple answer is to turn your questions upside down and pose them in terms of their opposites. Do we transmit poverty to our children? Absolutely. Do we transmit all of it? Well, what does it matter? Are there historical mechanisms of reshuffling poverty? Not really, except if one is thinking about revising the threshold of the breadline in order to include more people or less people.When you talk about generational changes from wealthy to poor (e.g. 1917 Russia, or 1947 China, etc.), you do not contradict the assumption I make that the population of the poor is, or remains, high (and higher than the population of the rich). Here you seem to be providing evidence that the population of the poor routinely gets added to by thinning out the ranks of the rich. That many Russian princes became taxi drivers in Paris in the 1920s actually proves my point: the population of the poor is readily absorbent; that of the rich seems to get leaner and leaner. But why is this the case? Ultimately, are you saying that generational changes from wealthy to poor are the reason the population of the rich never increases to the point of matching or outgrowing that of the poor? I am not sure I get your point. The question is not how one becomes wealthy from a poor background, like Kirk Douglas, but why one who becomes wealthy like Kirk Douglas does not cause a population increase among the rich. One can be self-made, can educate themselves up the social ladder, or steal to get there, or inherit a fortune, or win the Lottery, and so on, but the question remains: why do the rich not increase (until, eventually, they are more than the poor? Your answer seems to be that the world maintains a tit-for-tat universal equilibrium because “there are transitions up and down”. But clearly more people become poor than become rich, so this transition cannot result in a tit-for-tat equilibrium.How do I define wealthy vs poor? The poor, as I said, live in the Petri dishes of Rocinha, Kibera, Dharavi, Grenfell, Ramat Elhanan, Downtown Eastside Vancouver, South Bronx, Los Pajaritos et al. The poor, as I said, are those whose population is always higher than that of the rich despite living harder lives (less medical care, poorer diets, less money to spent, permanent austerity). The “access questions”, which you say determine one’s life expectancy, and the issue of access – which is say is the only relevant issue – are roundly contradicted by the fact that the poor continue to live where they would rather not live, continue to eat what they would rather not eat, and to take home wages that they would rather were increased etc. Some call it resilience. (I think the whole resilience discourse is rubbish). That the poor since time immemorial continue to live where amenities are fewest and poorly maintained, and where life is hardest, suggests that access determines little, if anything, in this larger question about the populations of the poor and the populations of the rich.Thus I am not overly convinced that the issue is better phrased as Access rather than Wealth.

Normally for a region (open and connect set ) in the plane the space of C^k(A) for real functions with all derivatives in each variable x and y of order <=k.  Smooth normally implies k=infinity but not necessarily.  There are plenty of examples of smooth functions that do not have a convergent Taylor series that equals the function in the region.  The term analytic is reserved for functions of x and y where where the Taylor series converges and is equal the function in the region.  The functions in either case can be complex valued or real valued.  The third concept is holomorphic which is a complex valued function considered as a function of the complex variable z=x+iy.  If such a function is differentiable as a function of the complex variable z, then it is holomorphic.  That is a very strong condition as all holomorphic functions satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann differential equations, the zeros of a holomorphic function is a discrete set (implying that in a bounded subset of the region A over which it is holomorphic it only has a finite number of zeros.  However, for a complex valued function of a complex variable, analysis and holomorphic are the same (sometimes a source of confusion). Of course the beauty of the Riemann surface arose out of the study of multivalued functions in complex analysis.  Just follow the trajectory of the function f(z)=sqrt(z) around the unit circle.  On the Riemann surface (covering space of the function) the functions becomes single valued as the surface is constructed from the complex algebraic curved defined by the solution of the polynomial P(wiz) = w^2-z.

В социальной философии мораль понимается как форма общественного сознания, в которой выражаются моральные представления людей, социальных групп и общества в целом, нормы и суждения о человеческом поведении. Для понимания сущности морали очень важно определить соотношение понятий «этикет» и «этика», которые семантически близки к этому понятию, но в некоторых отношениях различаются. Если понятие морали часто понимается как форма общественного сознания (то есть воспринимаемые нормы и правила), этикет воплощает живую сферу применения норм и правил. Другими словами, сфера этикета - это отношения между людьми, которые формируют их отношения в реальной жизни. Этика считается такой философской областью, которая изучает нормы человеческой деятельности, нравов и этики. На протяжении веков этические нормы означали моральные ценности. Нравственность - одно из древнейших социальных явлений. Долгое время он был единственным регулятором в сообществе.

Этика… надиндивидуальна, регламентирована и релятивная, поэтому нравственная личность не может безропотно подчиняться ей…\" (Швейцер А.). Здесь очевидно несовпадение морали и нравственности. Мораль – модель идеального, должного поведения, в ее предписаниях выражен общий интерес данного сообщества людей. Для социума важно ее выживание, самосохранение. Отсюда и поощрение таких желаемых качеств, как милосердие, альтруизм и т. п. Мораль – это совокупность норм, выработанных определенным обществом для регулирования взаимоотношений между ее членами. Из того, что мораль и нравственность не совпадают, не следует что они независимы друг от друга и между ними нет связи. Мораль и нравственность взаимно обусловлены и взаимосвязаны. Моральные нормы являются ориентирами для нравственного выбора личности, соизмеряясь с которыми личность осуществляет свой выбор.

There the people have had to integrate into the ecology and climatic conditions of the region.

Well this is a great hope for humanity that we have this level of sensitivity in our thinking and also the common sense to understand that if we wish to survive in the future we will need to understand and react positively to the drive to maintain ecological well-being and the sustainability of our world. So relating this to the aspect of global warming – that decision not to mine in an area that would destroy a forest, which if the mining happens would increase CO2 levels and then to choose to protect a wetland from destruction through mining or development, which would be important to ensure water cleansing and the continuation of bird, animal, plant and insect life - these are important and positive aspects that need be part of the globalisation thinking.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"3"},{"answer_post_date":"24th May, 2019","answer_content":"yes sir it is big issuethe developer never follow the ecological concern. all r in ecology.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"26th May, 2019","answer_content":"I think so, because ecology plays an important role in decision making, so for many aspects we should take into account as to prevent CC which need a globalisation to resolve or to prevent bad consequences","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"3rd Jun, 2019","answer_content":"Globalization is influenced by Ecology in a massive role as it also impacts Ecology evolution in time.

Biodiversity of the Earth's biosphere is therefore very important, because if we don't take care of it, we can soon destroy civilization. Maintaining the biodiversity of the Earth's biosphere is a key challenge for humanity in the 21st century. If humanity does not protect biodiversity against the negative factors of civilization development, the deepening imbalance in nature will lead to exceeding the critical point of this imbalance, after which crossing will no longer be possible to return to balance and the destruction of many life forms, including people, may be inevitable already XXII century. Exceeding this critical point of equilibrium in nature may appear in a dozen or so years if the acceleration rate of the global warming process is still as fast as in recent years. so there is not much time left for humanity to realize how important it is to protect the biodiversity of the Earth's biosphere and how quickly the necessary ecological reforms should be carried out. The strong increase in the scale of forest fires in various climate zones of the planet Earth recorded in 2019 is a serious warning signal for humanity. This is a kind of SOS signal sent by Earth's nature towards man, that the development of civilization with the negative effects of this development is approaching the critical point of imbalance in nature. After crossing this critical point, it will no longer be possible to stop the global warming process that is accelerating and the destruction of most of the Earth's biosphere at the end of the 21st century will become a reality. Time is running out. In this connection, the key question arises: what should a man do regarding the implementation of the principles of sustainable ecological development in the coming years? How to protect the Earth's biosphere, natural biodiversity and thus also humanity against destruction, against climate armageddon at the end of the 21st century? The next several years is the last moment to carry out the necessary ecological reforms to avoid a chain reaction of increasing climatic disasters and reduce the scale of environmental pollution and protect most of the remaining biosphere, biodiversity from irreversible degradation. Therefore, humanity should reduce greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, develop energy based on renewable energy sources, electromobility, organic farming, sorting garbage, recycling, etc. It is necessary to implement the principles of sustainable ecological development as soon as possible in accordance with the green economy philosophy and ecological financing reforms from green finance sources. Time is short. It is not certain that humanity will completely reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. It is also not certain that if humanity succeeds, the global warming process will cease to deepen. However, implementing the principles of sustainable pro-ecological development is a necessity and the biggest challenge in the 21st century.Do you agree with me on the above matter? In view of the above, I am asking you the following questions:\n- Do you agree that one of the most important challenges for humanity in the 21st century is the protection of the Earth's biosphere and natural biodiversity?\n- What ecological activities and reforms as part of the implementation of the principles of sustainable economic development should be carried out and implemented in order to increase the effectiveness of the processes of protecting the Earth's biosphere and natural biodiversity?\nWhat do you think about this topic?\nWhat is your opinion on this topic?\nPlease reply\nI invite you to discussion\nThank you very much\nBest wishes\nDariusz Prokopowicz ","answer_image_url":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dariusz-Prokopowicz/post/Will_ecology_become_one_of_the_key_aspects_of_globalization_in_the_21st_century/attachment/5dd994c93843b0938392941c/AS%3A828497014562816%401574540489007/image/DISCUSSION_D.Prokopowicz_....Protecting+planet+Earth+and+natural+biodiversity.1.jpg","answer_votes":"1"},{"answer_post_date":"23rd Nov, 2019","answer_content":"Ecology is one of the most significant areas that could easily unite people globally - we are all witnesses of consequences oh unecological/ unsustainable behavior.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"2"},{"answer_post_date":"23rd Nov, 2019","answer_content":"I surely hope not.

People have moved across the world in search of land and space from more crowded areas. Sometimes these have been poorer people without resources and sometimes wealthier people but whatever their socio-economic circumstances they are determined to improve their economic well-being within the ecology of the area to which they are moving. There the people have had to integrate into the ecology and climatic conditions of the region. Perhaps this question posed is really asking whether consideration of the ecology will become a major component of globalisation. So, for instance, will global companies, for instance a mining company think carefully about the construction of a mine in a certain ecologically sensitive area, or will their shareholders and the public at large guide them to do so. Well this is a great hope for humanity that we have this level of sensitivity in our thinking and also the common sense to understand that if we wish to survive in the future we will need to understand and react positively to the drive to maintain ecological well-being and the sustainability of our world. So relating this to the aspect of global warming – that decision not to mine in an area that would destroy a forest, which if the mining happens would increase CO2 levels and then to choose to protect a wetland from destruction through mining or development, which would be important to ensure water cleansing and the continuation of bird, animal, plant and insect life - these are important and positive aspects that need be part of the globalisation thinking.","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"3"},{"answer_post_date":"25th Mar, 2022","answer_content":"The SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) coronavirus pandemic may have increased the scale of the pro-environmental transformation of the economy.

If I were one of the copies I would not consider myself immortal just because other copies forever lived on after my death. I would want it to be me that survives, not them.Moreover, with the scanning technique the original doesn't have to be dead but can continue its existence on Earth; that alone entails than no copy created at the destination can claim to be the same as, or a survivor of, an individual back on Earth.Bottomline: there must be spatiotemporal continuity for survival.

Here is a detailed and interesting article on the internet for anyone who is just starting look at the scientific progress of exploratory probes of interstellar space beyond our solar system:[Quoted Material Follows]Interstellar probeFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia📷\"Spacecraft that have left or are about to leave the Solar System (not including New Horizons)An interstellar probe is a space probe that has left—or is expected to leave—the Solar System and enter interstellar space, which is typically defined as the region beyond the heliopause. It also refers to probes capable of reaching other star systems.There are five interstellar probes, all launched by the American space agency NASA: Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11 and New Horizons. As of 2019, Voyager 1, Voyager 2 and Pioneer 10 are the only probes to have actually reached interstellar space.[1] The other three are on interstellar trajectories.The termination shock is the point in the heliosphere where the solar wind slows down to subsonic speed. Even though the termination shock happens as close as 80–100 AU (Astronomical unit) the maximum extent of the region in which the Sun's gravitational field is dominant (the Hill sphere) is thought to be at around 230,000 astronomical units (3.6 light-years).[2] This point is close to the nearest known star system, Alpha Centauri, located 4.36 light years away. Although the probes will be under the influence of the Sun for a long time, their velocities far exceed the Sun's escape velocity, so they will eventually leave forever.Interstellar space is defined as that which lies beyond a magnetic region that extends about 122 AU from the sun, as detected by Voyager 1, and the equivalent region of influence surrounding other stars. Voyager 1 entered interstellar space in 2012.[3]Interstellar Probe is also the name of a proposed NASA space probe intended to travel out 200 AU in 15 years, studied in 1999.[4]Interstellar Probe Explorer (ISP) is also the name of a new NASA robotic, one-way mission into the local interstellar medium over 50 years currently being studied by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. Building on the experience of the Voyager and New Horizons spacecraft, it will fly the first dedicated instruments designed to explore the environment of the nearby Milky Way. Traveling beyond the Sun's sphere of influence, it would be NASA's first dedicated mission to venture into the space between our star and other potentially habitable planetary systems.[5]In April 2016, scientists announced Breakthrough Starshot, a Breakthrough Initiatives program, to develop a proof-of-concept fleet of small centimeter-sized light sail spacecraft, named StarChip,[6] capable of making the journey to Alpha Centauri, the nearest extrasolar star system, at speeds of 20%[7][8] and 15%[9] of the speed of light, taking between 20 and 30 years to reach the star system, respectively, and about 4 years to notify Earth of a successful arrival.ContentsOverview[edit]Planetary scientist G. Laughlin noted that with current technology a probe sent to Alpha Centauri would take 40,000 years to arrive, but expressed hope for new technology to be developed to make the trip within a human lifetime.[10] On that timescale the stars move notably. As an example, in 40,000 years Ross 248 will be closer to Earth than Alpha Centauri.[11]📷Stars are literally moving targets on the time scales current technology might reach themOne technology that has been proposed to achieve higher speeds is an E-sail.[12] By harnessing solar wind, it might be possible to achieve 20-30 AU per year without even using propellant.[12]Existing interstellar probes[edit]📷Heliocentric positions of the five interstellar probes (squares) and other bodies (circles) until 2020, with launch and flyby dates. Markers denote positions on 1 January of each year, with every fifth year labelled.\nPlot 1 is viewed from the north ecliptic pole, to scale; plots 2 to 4 are third-angle projections at 20% scale.\nIn the SVG file, hover over a trajectory or orbit to highlight it and its associated launches and flybys.See also: List of artificial objects escaping from the Solar SystemFunctional spacecraft[edit]📷Artists view of a Voyager spacecraft in outer space.Voyager 1 (1977+)[edit]Voyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA on September 5, 1977. At a distance of about 148.42 AU (2.220×1010 km) as of 14 June 2021,[13][14] it is the farthest manmade object from Earth.[15]It was later estimated that Voyager 1 crossed the termination shock on December 15, 2004 at a distance of 94 AU from the Sun.[16][17]At the end of 2011, Voyager 1 entered and discovered a stagnation region where charged particles streaming from the Sun slow and turn inward, and the Solar System's magnetic field is doubled in strength as interstellar space appears to be applying pressure. Energetic particles originating in the Solar System declined by nearly half, while the detection of high-energy electrons from outside increases 100-fold. The inner edge of the stagnation region is located approximately 113 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun.[18]In 2013 it was thought Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause and entered interstellar space on August 25, 2012 at distance of 121 AU from the Sun, making it the first known human-manufactured object to do so.[19][20]As of 2017, the probe was moving with a relative velocity to the Sun of about 16.95 km/s (3.58 AU/year).[21]If it does not hit anything, Voyager 1 could reach the Oort cloud in about 300 years[22][23]Voyager 2 (1977+)[edit]📷Plot of Voyager 2's heliocentric velocity against its distance from the sun, illustrating the use of gravity assist to accelerate the spacecraft by Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. The spacecraft's encounter with Neptune actually decelerated the probe because of the way it encountered the planet.[24]Voyager 2 crossed the heliopause and entered interstellar space on November 5, 2018.[25] It had previously passed the termination shock into the heliosheath on October 30, 2007. As of 14 June 2021 Voyager 2 is at a distance of 123.12 AU (1.842×1010 km) from Earth.[26] The probe was moving at a velocity of 3.25 AU/year (15.428 km/s) relative to the Sun on its way to interstellar space in 2013.[27]It's moving at a velocity of 15.4 km/s (55,000 km/h) relative to the Sun as of December 2014.[28] Voyager 2 is expected to provide the first direct measurements of the density and temperature of the interstellar plasma.[29]New Horizons (2006+)[edit]New Horizons was launched directly into a hyperbolic escape trajectory, getting a gravitational assist from Jupiter en route. By March 7, 2008, New Horizons was 9.37 AU from the Sun and traveling outward at 3.9 AU per year. It will, however, slow to an escape velocity of only 2.5 AU per year as it moves away from the Sun, so it will never catch up to either Voyager. As of early 2011, it was traveling at 3.356 AU/year (15.91 km/s) relative to the Sun.[30] On July 14, 2015, it completed a flyby of Pluto at a distance of about 33 AU from the Sun.[31][32] New Horizons next encountered 486958 Arrokoth on January 1, 2019, at about 43.4 AU from the Sun.[33][34][35]The Heliosphere's termination shock was crossed by Voyager 1 at 94 astronomical units (AU) and Voyager 2 at 84 AU according to the IBEX mission.[36]If New Horizons can reach the distance of 100 AU, it will be traveling at about 13 km/s (29,000 mph), around 4 km/s (8,900 mph) slower than Voyager 1 at that distance.[37]Inactive missions[edit]Pioneer 10 (1972–2003)[edit]The last successful reception of telemetry from Pioneer 10 was on April 27, 2002, when it was at a distance of 80.22 AU, traveling at about 2.54 AU/year (12 km/s).[30]Pioneer 11 (1973–1995)[edit]Routine mission operations for Pioneer 11 were stopped September 30, 1995, when it was 6.5 billion km (approx 43.4 AU) from Earth, traveling at about 2.4 AU/year (11.4 km/s).[30]Probe debris[edit]New Horizons' third stage, a STAR-48 booster, is on a similar escape trajectory out of the Solar System as New Horizons, but will pass millions of kilometers from Pluto.[30] It crossed Pluto's orbit in October 2015.[30]The third stage rocket boosters for Pioneer 10, and for Voyager 1 and 2 are also on escape trajectories out of the Solar System.Trans-Neptunian probes at precursor distances[edit]📷Sedna art, more distant than Pluto and coming in for its perihelionIn the early 2000s many new, relatively large planetary bodies were found beyond Pluto, and with orbits extending hundreds of AU out past the heliosheath (90–1000 AU). The NASA probe New Horizons may explore this area now that it has performed its Pluto flyby in 2015 (Pluto's orbit ranges from about 29–49 AU). Some of these large objects past Pluto include 136199 Eris, 136108 Haumea, 136472 Makemake, and 90377 Sedna. Sedna comes as close as 76 AU, but travels out as far as 961 AU at aphelion, and minor planet (87269) 2000 OO67 goes out past 1060 AU at aphelion. Bodies like these affect how the Solar System is understood, and traverse an area previously only in the domain of interstellar missions or precursor probes. After the discoveries, the area is also in the domain of interplanetary probes; some of the discovered bodies may become targets for exploration missions,[38] an example of which is preliminary work on a probe to Haumea and its moons (at 35–51 AU).[39] Probe mass, power source, and propulsion systems are key technology areas for this type of mission.[38] In addition, a probe beyond 550 AU could use the Sun itself as a gravitational lens to observe targets outside the Solar System, such as planetary systems around other nearby stars,[40] although many challenges to this mission have been noted.[41]Proposed interstellar probes[edit]Missions that reach the interstellar medium or leave the heliosphere.Interstellar Express (IHP) (2019-)A CNSA space mission first proposed in 2019 would be launched in 2024 with the intention to research the heliosphere. Both probes would use gravity assists at Jupiter, and the second is planned to fly by Neptune and a Kuiper belt object. The other goal is to reach 100 AU from the Sun by 2049, the centennial of the People's Republic of China's foundation.[42]Interstellar Probe (ISP) (2018-)A NASA funded study, led by the Applied Physics Laboratory, on possible options for an interstellar probe. The nominal concept would launch on a SLS in the 2030s. It would perform a powered Jupiter flyby or a very close perihelion and propulsive maneuver, and reach a distance of 1000-2000 AU within fifty years. Possibilities for planetary, astrophysical and exoplanet science along the way are also being investigated.[43]Interstellar Heliopause Probe (IHP) (2006)A technology reference study published in 2006 with the ESA proposed an interstellar probe focused on leaving the heliosphere. The goal would be 200 AU in 25 years, with traditional launch but acceleration by a solar sail. The roughly 200–300 kg probe would carry a suite of several instruments including a Plasma Analyzer, Plasma radio wave experiment, Magnetometer, Neutral and charged atom detector, Dust analyzer, and a UV-photometer. Electrical power would come from an RTG.[44]📷NASA's Vision Mission; an early concept for the Innovative Interstellar Explorer📷Solar frontier as envisioned at the turn of century, on a logarithmic scale (1999)Innovative Interstellar Explorer (2003)NASA proposal to send a 35 kg science payload out to at least 200 AU. It would achieve a top speed of 7.8 AU per year using a combination of a heavy lift rocket, Jupiter gravitational assistance, and an ion engine powered by standard radioisotope thermal generators. The probe suggested a launch in 2014 (to take advantage of Jupiter gravitational assist), to reach 200 AU around 2044.[45]Realistic Interstellar Explorer and Interstellar Explorer (2000–2002)Studies suggest various technologies including Am-241-based RTG, optical communication (as opposed to radio), and low-power semi-autonomous electronics. Trajectory uses a Jupiter and Sun gravity assist to achieve 20 AU/year, allowing 1000 AU within 50 years, and a mission extension up to 20,000 AU and 1000 years. Needed technology included advanced propulsion and solar shield for perihelion burn around the Sun. Solar thermal (STP), nuclear fission thermal (NTP), and nuclear fission pulse, as well as various RTG isotopes were examined. The studies also included recommendations for a solar probe (see also Parker Solar Probe), nuclear thermal technology, solar sail probe, 20 AU/year probe, and a long-term vision of a 200 AU/year probe to the star Epsilon Eridani.[46]The \"next step\" interstellar probe in this study suggested a 5 megawatt fission reactor utilizing 16 metric tonnes of H2 propellant.[46] Targeting a launch in the mid-21st century, it would accelerate to 200 AU/year over 4200 AU and reach the star Epsilon Eridani after 3400 years of travel in the year 5500 AD.[46] However, this was a second-generation vision for a probe and the study acknowledged that even 20 AU/year might not be possible with then current (2002) technology.[46] For comparison, the fastest probe at the time of the study was Voyager 1 at about 3.6 AU/year (17 km/s), relative to the Sun.[30]Interstellar Probe (1999)Interstellar Probe was a proposed solar sail propulsion spacecraft planned by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It was planned to reach as far as 200 AU within 10 years at a speed of 14 AU/year (about 70 km/s, and function up to 400+ AU.[4] A critical technology for the mission is a large 1 g/m2 solar sail.📷TAU concept artTAU mission (1987)TAU mission (Thousand Astronomical Units) was a proposed nuclear electric rocket craft that used a 1 MW fission reactor and an ion drive with a burn time of about 10 years to reach a speed of 106 km/s (about 20 AU/year) to achieve a distance of 1000 AU in 50 years.[47] The primary goal of the mission was to improve parallax measurements of the distances to stars inside and outside our galaxy, with secondary goals being the study of the heliopause, measurements of conditions in the interstellar medium, and (via communications with Earth) tests of general relativity.[48]Interstellar concepts[edit]Project Orion (1958–1965)Project Orion was a proposed nuclear pulse propulsion craft that would have used fission or fusion bombs to apply motive force. The design was studied during the 1950s and 1960s in the United States of America, with one variant of the craft capable of interstellar travel.Bracewell probe (1960)Interstellar communication via a probe, as opposed to sending an electromagnetic signal.Sanger Photon Rocket (1950s-1964)Eugene Sanger proposed a spacecraft powered by antimatter in the 1950s.[49] Thrust was intended to come from reflected gamma-rays produced by electron-positron annihilation.[49]Enzmann Starship (1964/1973)Proposed by 1964 and examined in an October 1973 issue of Analog, the Enzmann Starship proposed using a 12,000 ton ball of frozen deuterium to power thermonuclear powered pulse propulsion.[50] About twice as long as the Empire State Building and assembled in-orbit, the spacecraft was part of a larger project preceded by large interstellar probes and telescopic observation of target star systems.[50][51][52]Project Daedalus (1973–1978)Project Daedalus was a proposed nuclear pulse propulsion craft that used inertial confinement fusion of small pellets within a magnetic field nozzle to provide motive force. The design was studied during the 1970s by the British Interplanetary Society, and was meant to flyby Barnard's Star in under a century from launch. Plans included mining Helium-3 from Jupiter and a pre-launch mass of over 50 thousand metric tonnes from orbit.Project Longshot (1987–1988)Project Longshot was a proposed nuclear pulse propulsion craft that used inertial confinement fusion of small pellets within a magnetic field nozzle to provide motive force, in a manner similar to that of Project Daedalus. The design was studied during the 1990s by NASA and the US Naval Academy. The craft was designed to reach and study Alpha Centauri.Starwisp (1985)Starwisp is a hypothetical unmanned interstellar probe design proposed by Robert L. Forward.[53][54] It is propelled by a microwave sail, similar to a solar sail in concept, but powered by microwaves from an artificial source.Medusa (1990s)Medusa was a novel spacecraft design, proposed by Johndale C. Solem, using a large lightweight sail (spinnaker) driven by pressure pulses from a series of nuclear explosions. The design, published by the British Interplanetary Society, was studied during the 1990s as a means of interplanetary travel.[55][56][57][58][59]Starseed launcher (1996)Starseed launcher was concept for launching microgram interstellar probes at up to 1/3 light speed.[60]AIMStar (1990s-2000s)AIMStar was a proposed antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion craft that would use clouds of antiprotons to initiate fission and fusion within fuel pellets.[61] A magnetic nozzle derived motive force from the resulting explosions. The design was studied during the 1990s by Penn State University. The craft was designed to reach a distance of 10,000 AU from the Sun in 50 years.📷NASA 2004 artist concept of an Interstellar Bussard ramjet engineProject Icarus (2009+)Project Icarus is a theoretical study for an interstellar probe and is being run under the guidance of the Tau Zero Foundation (TZF) and the British Interplanetary Society (BIS), and was motivated by Project Daedalus, a similar study that was conducted between 1973 and 1978 by the BIS.[62] The project is planned to take five years and began on September 30, 2009.[63]Project Dragonfly (2014+)The Initiative for Interstellar Studies (i4is) has initiated a project working on small interstellar spacecraft, propelled by a laser sail in 2014 under the name of Project Dragonfly.[64][65] Four student teams worked on concepts for such a mission in 2014 and 2015 in the context of a design competition.[66][67]Geoffrey A. Landis proposed for interstellar travel future-technology project interstellar probe with supplying the energy from an external source (laser of base station) and ion thruster.[68][69]Other interplanetary probes of interest[edit]Other probes of interest to suggested interstellar missions.📷the Ulysses has been referenced in regard to interstellar precursorsTechnologies[edit]Some technologies that have been discussed in relation to making an interstellar probe.Gravity assist[edit]Main article: Gravity assistA traditional gravity assist can be compared to throwing a tennis ball at a train (it rebounds not just with incoming velocity, but is accelerated by the train), it uses the gravity of a planet and its relative motion around the Sun compared to the spacecraft.[71] For example, Voyager 2 increased its velocity by performing gravity assists at Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.[72]Oberth effect[edit]Main article: Oberth effectHerman Oberth conceived of this type of gravity assist in 1929.[73]RTGs[edit]Main article: Radioisotope thermoelectric generatorAn example of RTG used on a probe leaving the Solar system is the Voyagers. Typically these have used Plutonium but an RTG using 241Am was proposed for an interstellar type mission in 2002.[46] This could support mission extensions up to 1000 years on the interstellar probe, because the power output would be more stable in the long-term than plutonium.[46] Other isotopes for RTG were also examined in the study, looking at traits such as watt/gram, half-life, and decay products.[46] An interstellar probe proposal from 1999 suggested using three advanced radioisotope power sources.[74] An RTG using 241Am was also studied as RTG fuel by the ESA[75]Ion engines[edit]Main article: Ion engineSolar sails[edit]Main article: Solar sailProbes messages[edit]See also: List of extraterrestrial memorials📷The Pioneer plaques are a pair of gold-anodized aluminium plaques placed on board the 1972 Pioneer 10 and 1973 Pioneer 11 spacecraft, featuring a pictorial message in case they are rediscovered📷Each Voyager Golden Record, as included aboard the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft, features audio recordings and encoded picturesSee also[edit]Selected programsOuter SpaceSpace travelReferences[edit]Further reading[edit]External links[edit]Categories:LanguagesEdit links[Quoted Material Ends.]SOURCE:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_probe  ","answer_image_url":null,"answer_votes":"8"},{"answer_post_date":"30th Jun, 2021","answer_content":"Dear Nancy Ann Watanabe,Thank you for the information provided regarding the history of scientific progress of interstellar exploration probes beyond our solar system.
